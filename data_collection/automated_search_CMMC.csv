Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech?

The focus of this article, however, is the relative scarcity of critical discussions about these issues in the country's vital alternative media.

The 2008 election represents, we argue, a moment when the scale and reach of blogging propelled it to a position of significance in New Zealand media. The study uses content analysis to track the material posted on these blogs and in their comments sections. It is concerned primarily with quantifying the kind of debate to be found there and, through that, analysing how these blogs contribute to the quality of public life. The findings show that while a small number of blogs dominate, one blog's comments section has seen significant growth in the number of individual commenters participating in political discussion. It therefore stands as a useful case study of how blogging has found a place within this country's mediated politics.

Self-reported survey data was most accurate for those activities that are most commonly performed. Less frequent users of the site displayed the lowest level of accuracy, reporting a propensity to perform activities that was not reflected in the survey logs.

Among the sample, 28.2% (n = 263) report current use of a mobile phone for sleep tracking. Income and gender were significant correlates of sleep tracking (p < 0.05). Compared to a poor diet, a reported ""excellent"" diet was associated with sleep tracking (p < 0.05). Interestingly, compared to individuals who never smoke, report of smoking ""everyday"" was associated with sleep tracking (p < 0.05). Finally, individuals who reported current use of their mobile device for other health functions (e.g., chat with their doctor or log symptoms) were more likely to report sleep tracking on their mobile device (p < 0.05). Results appear to suggest sleep tracking is common among individuals with good general health.

We explain why our approach is better than previous approaches using two data sets: one tracks digital news consumption during the 2016 Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom and the other during the 2016 Presidential Election in the United States.

Recent advances in advertising technology have lead to the development of ""native advertising,"" which is a format of advertising that mimics the other nonsponsored content on the medium. Whereas advertisers have rapidly embraced the format on a variety of digital media, regulators have expressed serious concerns about whether this format materially deceives consumers because the advertising disclosure is incomplete or inappropriate. This has reignited a longstanding debate about the distinction between advertising and content in media markets, and how it affects consumers. This paper contributes to this debate by providing empirical evidence from a randomized experiment conducted on native advertising at a mobile restaurant-search platform.

Hence, the denoiser obtained by minimizing the risk estimate does not require the clean speech prior. The stateof- the-art image denoising techniques optimize Steins unbiased risk estimate (SURE), which is an unbiased estimate of MSE, to obtain the optimum denoising function. Even though the MSE is a widely and successfully used distortion measure for signal denoising, in speech processing applications, distortion measures such as Itakura-Saito (IS), hyperbolic-cosine (cosh), weighted cosh, are known to be more perceptually relevant than MSE.

They are also nonconformist women who subvert heteronormative femininity through their involvement in punk culture. The multiple threats these skaters pose to television's heterovisuality thus require different strategies of containment than those typically used for other female athletes. A docu-soap that spends equal time on its characters' gaming and home lives, Rollergirls relies on roller derby's inherent melodrama to produce engaging entertainment while also imposing melodramatic elements on the skaters' off-track lives in order to contain their nonconformist gender performances.

PPWs can be seen as one of the few innovations in election campaigning that fully exploit the internet's interactive opportunities. The analysis in this article of the log files of 2003 and 2004 Belgian PPWs demonstrate that PPW users tend to be highly educated, male and young.

To examine this question, political ad tracking data were combined with a national daily survey collected during the 2000 election campaign cycle.

As white rappers whose language is grounded in vernacular Newfoundland English, their rap raises obvious questions relating to both authenticity and hybridization. Despite the group's use of local linguistic and semiotic resources to style young working-class Newfoundland male ""skeet"" identity, their authenticity as both workingclass Newfoundlanders and rappers was soon to be publicly contested. Though local language and dialect typically represent ""resistance vernaculars"" in global hip-hop, the use of vernacular Newfoundland English as a performance register on the part of Gazeebow Unit is shown to be considerably more complex. At one level at least, Gazeebow Unit are engaged in parody, or ""strategic inauthenticity,"" one ramification of which is to reproduce and reinforce dominant ideologies of social class.

The Guidance advises pharmaceuticals to use four information sources for consumers to seek further information to supplement broadcast drug advertisements: small-print information, the Internet, a toll-free number, and health-care providers (nurses, doctors, and pharmacists). Logistic models were created by using survey data collected by the Food and Drug Administration in 1999 and 2002. Results show that throughout the years, health-care providers remain the most used and strongest means associated with patients' direct requests for nonspecific and specific prescription drugs from doctors.

We find that the proportion of Internet users searching online for answers to specific questions—as opposed to casual browsing—has grown significantly. Moreover, as users get more experience online, they increasingly become dependent on search engines, confident in their findings, and savvy about how search engines structure information, privilege paid results, and track users. When other factors are controlled, years of online experience is a strong predictor of the likelihood of a person doing specific searches on a daily basis, and experience can have an even stronger positive effect than education and income. We also find that years of online experience, frequency of use, and sophistication with multiple search engines can overcome socio-economic status in predicting how active a person is )","2007","2020-06-05 21:15:37","2020-06-05 21:15:37","","846 - 865","","3","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Search engines; Internet industry; Internet users; Internet searching; Pew Internet & American Life Project (Company); Web search engines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These interaction settings are complex. The translation machine attempts to bridge the language gap by mediating the verbal communication, noting however that the technology may not be always perfect. In a step toward understanding user behavior in this mediated communication scenario, usability data from doctor–patient dialogs involving a two way English–Persian speech translation system are analyzed. We specifically consider user behavior in light of potential uncertainty in the communication between the interlocutors. We analyze the Retry (Repeat and Rephrase) versus Accept behaviors in the mediated verbal channel and as a result identify three user types –Accommodating, Normal and Picky, and propose a dynamic Bayesian network model of user behavior.

Significant progress has been made in broadband deployment in the last decade. Nevertheless, there are increasing gaps in broadband adoption, use and speed between, as well as within, the states. Federal and state legislators and regulators currently use a number of indicators such as adoption, availability and speed to track states’ progress in broadband diffusion in order to design appropriate policy responses. Single indicators, however, when analyzed individually, fall short of capturing multi-dimensional aspects of broadband diffusion and, thus, do not provide an integrated and easily comprehensible picture of states’ advancement. To monitor states’ overall progress it is useful to aggregate various indicators into a composite index that could measure the overall extent of broadband diffusion. A composite index can also provide with an important benchmark for d)","2011","2020-06-05 21:15:36","2020-06-05 21:15:36","","933 - 950","","11","35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Internet; Economic development; Communication policy; Benefit-of-the-doubt; Broadband; Broadband communication systems; Data envelopment analysis; Economic competition; National broadband map data; Second order stochastic dominance; Social development; Stochastic analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Service providers can now deploy new services over an IP network infrastructure without building their own networks. In an open network environment, the network resources of ISPs should be fairly open to third parties that plan to launch their own services over the network. To actively respond to the changing network paradigm, it is essential to measure the traffic of individual services, and to estimate their cost for cost accounting between service provider and ISP. However, current traffic measurement techniques only provide the total traffic volume in links, without reporting the operator whose services flow through the links. Some commercial products can classify traffic into each application at a specific spot, but we should install monitoring systems at every spot throughout the entire network in order to observe which service traffic flow)","2010","2020-06-05 21:15:35","2020-06-05 21:15:35","","58 - 65","","4","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Internet industry; Internet service providers; Computer network architectures; Information services industry; Internet Protocol multimedia subsystem; ISP (Computer program language)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
