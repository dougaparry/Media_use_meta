A large increase in student numbers necessitated us adapting a traditional practical report into an online test with automated marking. The assessment was designed to retain positive features of the traditional laboratory report but with added pedagogic and administrative benefits made possible through the online medium. After performing their experiments, students were given idealised data, enabling immediate comparison with their own results, and asked to perform a series of calculations based on that ideal data. The two‐part test asked questions about the students' calculations. Part I was formative, ensuring that the students had mastered basic concepts before advanced concepts were tested in Part II. The test rewarded correct methodology and understanding as well as the right answers and gave absolute consistency to the marking scheme. Students could submit at their convenience and received instant feedback. The assessment was met with emphatically positive feedback from students. In addition, it was possible to track submissions by students, providing insights into their behaviour. Students appeared to group into three submission styles—early submitters, considered submitters and last minute submitters—information which can be useful to guide pedagogic practice. In the latest iteration, analysis of submission behaviour gave us confidence to reduce the time before the submission deadline, which resulted in a substantial increase in student attainment.

Compared with general behavior, user listening behavior has a very strong time dependence in that users frequently change their music interest in different sessions, where the concept of a “session” is that of a single user continuously listening to songs over a period of time. However, most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics of both users and songs across sessions. In this paper, we analyze the temporal characters of a real music dataset from Last.fm and propose Time-based Markov Embedding (TME), a next-song recommendation model via Latent Markov Embedding, which boost the recommendation performance by leveraging temporal information. Specifically, we consider a scenario where user music interest is affected by long-term, short-term and session-term effects. By capturing temporal dynamics in the three effects, our model can track the change of user interest over time. We have conducted experiments on a Last.fm dataset. Results demonstrate that with our time-based model, the recommendation accuracy is significantly improved compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

These scenarios account for a large fraction of traffic fatalities world-wide. The comfort zone is a dynamic spatiotemporal envelope surrounding the vehicle, within which drivers feel comfortable and safe. The dread zone, a novel concept, describes a zone with a smaller safety margin that drivers will not voluntarily enter, but can push themselves into when conditions provide additional motivation (e.g., when hurried). Quantifying comfort- and dread-zone boundaries in the context of turning left before or after an oncoming vehicle has the potential to inform and improve both the design and driver acceptance of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. Using a within-subject design, a test-track experiment was conducted with drivers turning an instrumented vehicle left across the path of an oncoming vehicle. The oncoming vehicle was a self-propelled full-sized computer-controlled balloon vehicle going straight at a constant speed (50 km/h). The driver assumed full control of the instrumented vehicle approximately 20 m before the intersection and had to make the decision to turn left before or after the oncoming balloon vehicle. There were two experimental conditions, comfortable driving and hurried driving. Measures for each turn included post-encroachment time (PET), lateral acceleration, and self-reports of comfort and risk. Drivers consistently accepted shorter time gaps and higher lateral accelerations when hurried. We interpret these findings to suggest that drivers invoke two dynamic, contextually-defined safety margins. The first is the comfort-zone boundary, a limit which drivers do not voluntarily cross without  extra motives. The second is the dread-zone boundary, a more distant limit which drivers do not voluntarily cross even with extra motives. Grouping the responses (high/low) to the driver behavior questionnaire (DBQ) improved the ability to predict the dread-zone boundary PET given the comfort-zone boundary PET.

Our findings reveal positive effects of tracking time on time management skills. Variations in the channel, content and timing of the mobile notifications to foster reflective practice are investigated, and time-logging patterns are described.

Methods: A total of 358 survivors of breast cancer wore an accelerometer for 7 days at baseline to assess different activity intensities (light, lifestyle, and moderate to vigorous) and sedentary behavior. Six months later, survivors completed online questionnaires that assessed HRQOL indicators (disease-specific HRQOL, fatigue, depression, and anxiety) and relevant covariates. Relationships between activity and sedentary behavior quartiles and HRQOL indicator scores were examined using generalized liner models with Bonferroni multiple comparison adjustment. Results: After adjustment for covariates and sedentary time, each increasing lifestyle activity quartile was associated with reduced fatigue duration (P for trend, .03). Each increasing baseline moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) quartile was found to be significantly associated with higher Physical Well-Being, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) total, and trial outcome index scores; fewer breast cancer-specific concerns; and lower fatigue interference, and these differences were statistically and clinically significant between survivors in quartile 1 and quartile 4. After controlling for covariates and MVPA, relationships between sedentary time and HRQOL were mostly null with the exception of lower fatigue duration. Conclusions: Objectively measured MVPA was found to be positively associated with many HRQOL indicators. Lifestyle activity was found to be only inversely associated with fatigue duration whereas sedentary time was found to be positively associated with fatigue duration. Future research is warranted to explore these relationships further.

Intrusive use and manipulation of personal information not only affect people’s behaviour, but also they could have important implications for political and civic society. Previous research has relied on convenience samples and has often focused on one or only a few areas of use. The presented study, based on a probability sample, gives an overall picture of how privacy concerns are perceived in different online contexts and how socio-demography, internet experience, trust, and political orientation contribute to the understanding of privacy concerns in different settings. The results clearly point to privacy concerns as being very diverse and dependent on the applications in question. All dimensions that are used to explain privacy concerns are partly supported in the study. But their explanatory powers differ and not all areas of concern are affected by the same explanatory factors. Trust in other people is the single most important factor explaining privacy concerns when using digital media and applications. The more people trust others, the less concern they have for misuse of personal information.

The campaign resulted in a significant increase in youths’ confidence to identify healthy foods (OR 1.97, 95 % CI 1.01, 3.84,  p = .048), and a significant increase in per person per day servings of fruits (0.02, p = .03) and vegetables (0.01, p = .02). The results of our pilot were promising, and the integration of concepts from multiple theories benefited the implementation process.

PPGIS was implemented using both an internet application and with hardcopy maps in the field. Our research addressed two fundamental questions for park planning: (1) What is the spatial distribution of visitor activities and location-specific reasons for riding; and (2) What location-specific actions are needed to improve riding experiences? The spatial distributions of riding activities generated in PPGIS showed strong correlation with the GPS tracking results, with riding locations being related to the reasons for track selection. Riders proposed a broad range of management actions to improve riding experiences. PPGIS mapping provides a cost-effective approach to facilitate spatial decision making, allowing park agencies to prioritise future visitor management actions.

Little is known, however, about how we track and neurally represent others’ popularity. We addressed this question in two real-world social networks using sociometric methods to quantify popularity. Each group member (perceiver) viewed faces of every other group member (target) while whole-brain functional MRI data were collected. Independent functional localizer tasks were used to identify brain systems supporting affective valuation (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, amygdala) and social cognition (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, temporoparietal junction), respectively. During the face-viewing task, activity in both types of neural systems tracked targets’ sociometric popularity, even when controlling for potential confounds. The target popularity– social cognition system relationship was mediated by valuation system activity, suggesting that observing popular individuals elicits value signals that facilitate understanding their mental states. The target popularity–valuation system relationship was strongest for popular perceivers, suggesting enhanced sensitivity to differences among other group members’ popularity. Popular group members also demonstrated greater interpersonal sensitivity by more accurately predicting how their own personalities were perceived by other individuals in the social network.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-31678-001). Traditionally, assessment of functional and cognitive status of individuals with dementia occurs in brief clinic visits during which time clinicians extract a snapshot of recent changes in individuals’ health. Conventionally, this is done using various clinical assessment tools applied at the point of care and relies on patients’ and caregivers’ ability to accurately recall daily activity and trends in personal health. These practices suffer from the infrequency and generally short durations of visits. Since 2004, researchers at the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology (ORCATECH) at the Oregon Health and Science University have been working on developing technologies to transform this model. ORCATECH researchers have developed a system of continuous in-home monitoring using pervasive computing technologies that make it possible to more accurately track activities and behaviors and measure relevant intra-individual changes. We have installed a system of strategically placed sensors in over 480 homes and have been collecting data for up to 8 years. Using this continuous in-home monitoring system, ORCATECH researchers have collected data on multiple behaviors such as gait and mobility, sleep and activity patterns, medication adherence, and computer use. Patterns of intra-individual variation detected in each of these areas are used to predict outcomes such as low mood, loneliness, and cognitive function. These methods have the potential to improve the quality of patient health data and in turn patient care especially related to cognitive decline. Furthermore, the continuous real-world nature of the data may improve the efficiency and ecological validity of clinical intervention studies.

We analyzed log-file data from the CPS item  Climate Control encompassing N = 16,219 students from 44 countries and economies. In Research Question 1, we related the application of an optimal exploration strategy (i.e., vary-one-thing-at-at-time, VOTAT) to performance on this specific problem and to overall level of CPS proficiency, both on an individual and on the country level. In Research Question 2, we identified several groups of students with different levels of non-mastery on a fine-grained level. Results indicated that (1) the VOTAT strategy was strongly related to performance on the Climate Control item as well as to overall problem solving proficiency, and (2) that there were different levels of non-mastery that ranged from applying no systematic strategic behavior to actually applying VOTAT but still failing to solve the item. On the backdrop of these results, we discuss implications and future potentials of log-file analyses in educational large-scale assessments for researchers, teachers, and policy makers.

Participants completed a total of 2261 online surveys measuring perceived thermal comfort, lighting comfort and noise annoyance, measures of work performance, and individual state factors underlying performance and wellbeing. Characterising inadequate aspects of IEQ as environmental stressors, these stress factors can significantly reduce self-reported work performance and objectively measured cognitive performance by between 2.4% and 5.8% in most situations, and by up to 14.8% in rare cases. Environmental stressors act indirectly on work performance by reducing state variables, motivation, tiredness, and distractibility, which support high-functioning work performance. Exposure to environmental stress appears to erode individuals' resilience, or ability to cope with additional task demands. These results indicate that environmental stress reduces not only the cognitive capacity for work, but the rate of work (i.e. by reducing motivation). Increasing the number of individual stress factors is associated with a near linear reduction in work performance indicating that environmental stress factors are additive, not multiplicative. Environmental stressors reduce occupant wellbeing (mood, headaches, and feeling ‘off’) causing indirect reductions in work performance. Improving IEQ will likely produce small but pervasive increases in productivity.

Little empirical data are available on patient interest in electronic communication and Web-based health tools that are technically feasible but not widely available. Research Objective: To explore patient behavior and interest in using the Internet to contact physicians. Design: National cross-sectional online survey. Participants: A sample of 4,510 CVS customers with at least one chronic condition in the household was used to target patients with chronic conditions and their caregivers. Subjects were identified from a national panel of over 100,000 retail pharmacy customers. Of those sampled, 2,252 responded (50.0 % response rate). Main Measures: Survey measures included demographic and health information, patient use of email and Facebook to contact physicians, and patient interest in and use of Web-based tools for health. Key Results: A total of 37 % of patients reported contacting their physicians via email within the last six months, and 18 % via Facebook. Older age was negatively associated with contacting physicians using email (OR 0.57 [95 % CI 0.41–0.78]) or Facebook (OR 0.28 [0.17–0.45]). Non-white race (OR 1.61 [1.18–2.18] and OR 1.82 [1.24–2.67]) and caregiver status (OR 1.58 [1.27–1.96] and OR 1.71 [1.31– 2.23]) were positively associated with using email and Facebook, respectively. Patients were interested in using Web-based tools to fill prescriptions, track their own health, and access health information (37–57 %), but few were currently doing so (4–8 %). Conclusions: In this population of retail pharmacy users, there is strong interest among patients in the use of email and Facebook to communicate with their physicians. The findings highlight the gap between patient interest for online communication and what physicians may currently provide. Improving and accelerating the adoption of secure Web messaging systems is a possible solution that addresses both institutional concerns and patient demand.

This study sought to: (a) examine the utility of a well-established, adult-based computerized tool, CogSport for Kids (CogState), for evaluating information-processing skills in children and adolescents; and (b) to report normative data for healthy children and adolescents. The study was a cross-sectional, community-based observational study of typically developing children aged 9 to 17 years old ( N = 832). Participants completed the CogSport for Kids test battery, which includes six brief computerized tasks that assess cognitive functions including processing speed, attention, and working memory. Results showed an improvement with age for response speed and accuracy. The greatest change occurred between 9 and 12 years with performance stabilizing at 15 years.

A significant segment of the U.S. population, under-represented students, is under-engaged or disengaged in secondary science education. International and national assessments and various research studies illuminate the problem and/or the disparity between students’ aspirations in science and the means they have to achieve them. To improve engagement and address inequities among these students, more contemporary and/or inclusive pedagogy is recommended. More specifically, multicultural science education has been suggested as a potential strategy for increased equity so that all learners have access to and are readily engaged in quality science education. While multicultural science education emphasizes the integration of students’ backgrounds and experiences with science learning , multimedia has been suggested as a way to integrate the fundamentals of multicultural education into learning for increased engagement. In addition, individual characteristics such as race, sex, academic track and grades were considered. Therefore, this study examined the impact of multicultural science education, multimedia, and individual characteristics on under-represented students’ engagement in secondary science. Method. The Under-represented Students Engagement in Science Survey (USESS), an adaptation of the High School Survey of Student Engagement, was used with 76 high-school participants. The USESS was used to collect pretest and posttest data concerning their types and levels of student engagement. Levels of engagement were measured with Strongly Agree ranked as 5, down to Strongly Disagree ranked at 1. Participants provided this feedback prior to and after having interacted with either the multicultural or the non-multicultural version of the multimedia science curriculum. Descriptive statistics for the study’s participants and the survey items, as well as Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for internal consistency reliability with respect to the survey subscales, were conducted. The reliability results prompted exploratory factory analyses, which resulted in two of the three subscale factors, cognitive and behavioral, being retained. One-within one-between subjects ANOVAs, independent samples t-test, and multiple linear regressions were also used to examine the impact of a multicultural science education, multimedia, and individual characteristics on students’ engagement in science learning. Results. There were main effects found within subjects on posttest scores for the cognitive and behavioral subscales of student engagement. Both groups, using their respective versions of the multimedia science curriculum, reported increased engagement in science learning. There was also a statistical difference found for the experimental group at posttest on the measure of “online science was more interesting than school science.” All five items unique to the posttest related to the multimedia variable were found to be significant predictors of cognitive and/or behavioral engagement. Conclusions. Engagement in science learning increased for both groups of participants; this finding is aligned with other significant research findings that more embracive and relevant pedagogies can potentially benefit all students. The significant difference found for the experimental group in relation to the multimedia usage was moderate and also may have reflected positive responses to other questions about the use of technology in science learning. As all five measures of multimedia usage were found to be significant predictors of student engagement in science learning, the indications were that: (a) technical difficulties did not impede engagement; (b) participants were better able to understand and visualize the physics concepts as they were presented in a variety of ways; (c) participants’ abilities to use computers supported engagement; (d) participants… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","2016","2020-06-05 21:20:54","2020-06-05 21:20:54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","APA PsycInfo®","1769711542; 2016-99010-070","","","Publication Title: Dissertation Abstracts International Section A: Humanities and Social Sciences AAI3685456","","","http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:APA+PsycInfo%C2%AE&atitle=&title=Under-represented+students%27+engagement+in+secondary+science+learning%3A+A+non-equivalent+control+group+design&issn=&date=2016-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Vann-Hamilton%2C+Joy+J.&isbn=978-1-321-61543-2&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2016-99010-070&rft_id=info:doi/","Learning; Student Engagement; Multimedia; Human; Empirical Study; science education; Sciences; Quantitative Study; Science Education; 3500:Educational Psychology; address inequities; Experiment Controls; experimental group; exploratory factory analyses; multicultural science education; multimedia science curriculum; non-multicultural version; science learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"TUYT6XTA","thesis","2016","Sutherland, Scot McRobert","Constraint-referenced analytics of algebra learning in classroom network contexts","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1769711931?accountid=14026","The rapid development of Internet and telecommunications technologies have shifted primary goal of education from the acquisition of knowledge to the application of knowledge. Search engines and specialized apps provide instant access to information making what a person can do more important than how much they know. A shift in educational goals requires a similar shift in educational assessment, away from tests based on knowledge of content to the measurement of the cognitive processes that lead to learning. Algebra has become the  de facto gatekeeper to higher education for high school students in the United States. About 40% of high school juniors are unable to answer even the simplest algebra items on standardized tests. Many students struggle when they face the dramatic increase in cognitive complexity as they make the transition from arithmetic to algebra. This dissertation study presents an initial validation argument for a novel constraint- referenced analytics method for measuring cognitive processes during algebra learning in the context of activities conducted with a classroom network of handheld devices. Measurements are taken at the domain level with reference to a constraint-based model of algebra itself rather than particular test items and answers drawn from curricular content. Two main research questions guide this study: 1) Can the constraint-referenced analytics system measure the development of cognitive skill within the learning context without the use of separate test items? 2) To what degree do the results of these measurements support both summative and formative purposes? Data collection took place in two algebra lab classes conducted at a semi-urban high school. Fifty-four students in grades 9 through 12 enrolled in the algebra lab class if they had passed previous algebra class and were concurrently enrolled in a traditional first year algebra class taught by any of seven algebra teachers. Activities involved students working together to replace one algebraic expression with an equivalent expression of a different form on calculators that served as handheld devices on a classroom network. The constraint-referenced analytics engine processed log files of student inputs. Results showed that the symbolic and cognitive complexity of the replacement attempts significantly and negatively influenced success rate. These results were consistent for both classes providing initial evidence for constraint-referenced analytics as a valid method for measurement of cognitive processes during equivalent transformations of algebraic expressions. Three reviewers, the algebra lab teacher, a teaching colleague at the same high school, and an independent reviewer, examined the diagnostic utility of thirteen student records constructed from constraint-referenced analytics and traditional quiz and test scores. All reviewers made diagnostic judgments and proposed instructional strategies based upon the student records reviewed. All agreed that constraint-referenced measures provided insights not found in traditional assessment scores. Charts of performance over time derived form constraint-referenced analytics revealed that learning took place when students encountered a period of struggle, persisted by attempting similarly complex transformations until a moment of insight occurred, after which they were consistently successful. Only 14 cases of learning were found in 94 periods of struggle. Students typically resolved the struggle by switching to familiar transformations or choosing non-participation. Constraint-referenced analytics shows promise for addressing the need for assessment of learning processes by providing a method of measurement embedded in the learning environment, not tied to curricular content and suitable for summative and formative purposes.

This book documents how a group of three eighth-grade girls developed specific group practices typical of such thinking in an online educational experience. A longitudinal case study tracks the team during eight hour-long sessions, following the students' meaning-making processes during their mutual chat responses preserved in computer logs coordinated with their geometric actions. The examination of data focuses on key areas of the team's development: its effective team collaboration, its productive mathematical discourse, its enacted use of dynamic-geometry tools, and its ability to identify and construct dynamic-geometry dependencies. This detailed study of group cognition serves as a paradigmatic example of computer-supported collaborative learning, incorporating a unique model of human-computer interaction analysis applied to the use of innovative educational technology. A valuable resource for researchers, instructors, and students alike, it offers concrete suggestions for improving educational practice.

This study investigated these specific questions: (1) To what extent was involvement in a German-speaking community a learning goal for the beginner-level college students of German who participated in this study? (2) Which aspects of Communities were more or less important to these learners? (3) How did the learners who had a strong and those who had a weak orientation toward Communities compare in their self-reports across these variables: (a) the German-speaking communities with which they communicated in any language and in German, respectively; (b) the frequency with which they communicated with those German-speaking communities in any language and in German, respectively; and (c) the technologies they used to communicate with German-speaking communities outside of class, in any language and in German, respectively? The study had three components: (1) A baseline questionnaire that was completed by 23 learners in first-semester German classes to explore their learning goals, social networks, use of German beyond the classroom setting, and technology use behaviors; (2) daily and weekly technology use logs filled out by six of the learners who had completed the baseline questionnaire to keep track of whether, how, why, and with whom they had used various digital tools; and (3) individual and group interviews with the same six learners to elaborate on each of the topics from the baseline questionnaire. Results indicated that participants defined only native speakers (NSs) of the target language (TL) who live in a TL-speaking country as their aspirational (idealized) community and paid little attention to local communities of NSs or, most particularly, non-native speakers (i.e., their peers). The use of technology to maintain ties with members of students' aspirational community (i.e., NSs) was reported in very few instances and not a single participant reported using technology to establish contact with members of such a group. These findings are further discussed in light of pedagogical implications and suggestions for further research.

The tool consists of an activity monitor (accelerometer), wirelessly connected to a Smartphone and a web application. Use of this tool is combined with a behaviour change counselling protocol (the Self-management Support Programme) based on the Five A's model (Assess–Advise–Agree–Assist–Arrange). Objectives: To examine the reach, implementation and satisfaction with the counselling protocol and the tool. Design: A process evaluation was conducted in two intervention groups of a three-armed cluster randomised controlled trial, in which the counselling protocol was evaluated with (group 1,  n = 65) and without (group 2, n = 66) the use of the tool using a mixed methods design. Settings: Sixteen family practices in the South of the Netherlands. Participants: Practice nurses ( n = 20) and their associated physically inactive patients ( n = 131), diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or Type 2 Diabetes, aged between 40 and 70 years old, and having access to a computer with an Internet connection. Methods: Semi structured interviews about the receipt of the intervention were conducted with the nurses and log files were kept regarding the consultations. After the intervention, questionnaires were presented to patients and nurses regarding compliance to and satisfaction with the interventions. Functioning and use of the tool were also evaluated by system and helpdesk logging. Results: Eighty-six percent of patients (group 1: n = 57 and group 2: n = 56) and 90% of nurses (group 1: n = 10 and group 2: n = 9) responded to the questionnaires. The execution of the Self-management Support Programme was adequate; in 83% (group 1: n = 52, group 2: n = 57) of the patients, the number and planning of the consultations were carried out as intended. Eighty-eight percent ( n = 50) of the patients in group 1 used the tool until the end of the intervention period. Technical problems occurred in 58% ( n = 33). Participants from group 1 were significantly more positive: patients: χ²(2, N = 113) = 11.17, p = 0.004, and nurses: χ²(2, N = 19) = 6.37, p = 0.040. Use of the tool led to greater awareness of the importance of physical activity, more discipline in carrying it out and more enjoyment. Conclusions: The interventions were adequately executed and received as planned. Patients from both groups appreciated the focus on physical activity and personal attention given by the nurse. The most appreciated aspect of the combined intervention was the tool, although technical problems frequently occurred. Patients with the tool estimated more improvement of physical activity than patients without the tool.

This study addressed the issue of job satisfaction and organizational commitment in non-tenure track faculty (NTTF) in master's level universities. Theoretical Framework. Gappa, Austin, and Trice's (2007) Framework of Essential Elements for Faculty Work served as the basis for the theoretical framework of this study. This study investigated the relationship between the demographic characteristics, appointment types and the essential elements of faculty work (employment equity; academic freedom and autonomy; flexibility; professional growth and collegiality) and the two outcome variables of faculty satisfaction and organizational commitment in NTTF. Methodology. A 20 question online survey of NTTF in five universities within a single public system was used to determine the relationship of demographic characteristics (age, gender, race and ethnicity, marital status, and educational level), departmental policies and practices (academic freedom and autonomy, employment equity, professional growth, flexibility, and collegiality), and nature of appointment (full- or part-time and academic discipline) on job satisfaction and organizational commitment and to investigate relationships between the dependent variables. Data analysis consisted of bivariate and multivariate analysis. Findings and Conclusions. The overall majority of the sample was satisfied and committed to the university, with no significant differences between full- and part-time NTTF. All of the departmental policies had a medium to large effect on both job satisfaction and organizational commitment for NTTF, with employment equity being the strongest predictor. Voluntary non-tenure track status and voluntary part-time status was positively related to both job satisfaction and organizational commitment for NTTF, and explained some of the differences based on demographic characteristics. Job satisfaction had a large relationship to organizational commitment for NTTF. Intervention at the departmental level could have a positive impact on job satisfaction and organizational commitment for NTTF. Recommendations. Future research should investigate how to increase employment equity and professional growth for NTTF. Universities and individual departments need to work to ensure that NTTF feel they are treated fairly and should also work to provide professional growth opportunities especially for those NTTF whose primary work is for the university.

"4BZUH34R","thesis","2016","Pearce, Dennis E.","Developing a method for measuring ""Working Out Loud""","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1786799729?accountid=14026","Enterprise social network software platforms (ESNs) are increasingly being deployed in firms across almost every industry as a means of fostering employee collaboration. Although benefits in increased productivity, innovation, and employee engagement are highly touted, there is a high failure rate of these deployments. This often occurs because (1) there is a misapplied focus on technology adoption rather than adoption of the employee behaviors that are ultimately required to obtain those benefits, and (2) it is unclear what those behaviors are and how to measure them. ""Working Out Loud"" is one possible framework for understanding and measuring the behaviors necessary to fulfill the promise that ESN vendors advertise. It is loosely described as doing work in a way that makes it visible to others, and is often associated with the use of social business tools. As these tools proliferate within organizations, the Working Out Loud concept is becoming increasingly popular as an organizational and individual goal and mantra among social software vendors, their customers, and leading pundits and consultants in this space. Many benefits have been associated with Working Out Loud; however the concept is still somewhat amorphous. No attempts have been made to quantify it and little research has been done on whether the benefits attributed to it really exist. The common industry definition of Working Out Loud identifies two separate behaviors: narrating one's work in the form of blog posts, status updates, etc. (typically individual behavior), and performing work in a transparent and observable way through the use of an enterprise social platform (typically group or team behavior). This research hypothesizes that these two behaviors do exist and are related but distinct, and thus scales can be developed to measure each. A survey was given to employees of Lexmark International, Inc. (the author's employer). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses performed on the data confirmed the hypothesis and resulted in scales for individual and group Working Out Loud that are designed to be minimally intrusive so as to enable both researchers and practitioners to track an organization's Working Out Loud behavior on an ongoing basis.

"GXKPUHED","thesis","2016","Russell, Jamaal Akii","Understanding the utility of Over-The-Counter (OTC) medications and emergency department (ed) data in a syndromic surveillance system","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1798733098?accountid=14026","In April 2009 two pediatric cases of Influenza-Like-Illness (ILI) were reported in southern California and were positive for swine influenza A (H1N1) virus (MMWR, 2009). Heightened surveillance is needed to track and monitor this emerging pathogen. One of the main ideas to strengthen capacity was heightened surveillance or syndromic surveillance. Syndromic surveillance is the systemic and ongoing assessment of the syndromes, including the timely collection, analysis, interpretation, dissemination, and subsequent use of data. Surveillance of Over-The-Counter (OTC) medication sales and Emergency Department (ED) syndromic surveillance are just a few of the new methods developed for early detection of outbreaks. These new surveillance techniques utilize computer databases and statistical packages to store and analyze the data. New/seasonal outbreaks in Montgomery County in 2007-2010 were used to retrospectively interpret data. These outbreaks included novel H1N1, seasonal influenza, and seasonal norovirus that occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland. This study used data from the Electronic Surveillance System for Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE) syndromic surveillance system. Several syndromic categories were used and created to retrospectively determine at what point in time the outbreak would have been detectable. The categories include: Seasonal/H1N1 ILI, and Gastrointestinal Illness. Regression/Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) 1.1 was used to analyze the Montgomery County Health Department's syndromic surveillance data. This research explored whether ED or OTC data provide an alert first and what is the temporal difference between the two. The hypotheses tested for this study was: 1) There is a temporal difference between the purchase of OTC medications and ED visits in a given community with ED visits alerts posting before OTC medications among Seasonal flu and H1N1 outbreaks. 2) Individual hospitals ED's with the smallest patient loads will have a different pattern of alerts than the larger ED's. This study found that an alert will not always appear in OTC data before it appears in ED data depending on the type of outbreak and alert criteria used by the epidemiologist. The alert criteria are crucial in determining when an outbreak is suspected and when to initiate a response from public health. Large hospitals mirrored countywide data. Smaller hospital's ED visits are too sparse to be representative of countywide trends. There is no way to determine whether ED data or OTC data will produce an earlier signal. The different symptomatology and type of outbreak will affect the timeliness of alerts from each data stream. The findings of this study will benefit local and state government agencies response to an outbreak/bioterrorist event.

"SAWVREZA","thesis","2016","daSilva, Elizabeth Bendycki","Behavioral and neurophysiological investigations of emotional face perception","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1799004000?accountid=14026","A smiling face can signal many things, ranging from stable traits such as a potentially pleasant disposition to current emotional states. This dissertation incorporates behavioral and neurophysiological methods across four studies to assess emotion perception. Of particular interest is how raters evaluate emotion when information is limited (e.g. only the lower face is presented) or emotions could be easily confused (e.g. happiness vs. pride). Does the happiness superiority effect (e.g. Calvo & Lundqvist, 2008; Leppanen & Hietanen, 2004), wherein happy expressions are recognized faster and more accurately than other expressions extend to other positive emotion categories (e.g. pride), or is there something affectively, or visually, distinct about the happiness display? In Study 1, participants evaluated facial emotion stimuli, making behavioral judgments of emotional expressions across several domains, including: 1) traits (e.g. ""how dominant is this person""); 2) arousal (e.g. ""calm""); 3) valence (e.g. ""negative""); 4) emotion (e.g. ""how happy is this person?""). To understand how participants evaluate and differentiate between competing positive emotion labels, in Study 2 behavioral data in the form of computer mouse trajectories were recorded during a forced-choice emotion discrimination task, finding different response profiles for happiness compared to pride. In addition to these behavioral measures, in Study 3 electroencephalography (EEG) was used to track neural processing during emotion judgments. Event-related potentials (ERPs) starting around 200 ms post-stimulus onset distinguished between emotional expressions and neutral expressions, but it was not until later in time (~800 ms) that the brain differentiated between happy and proud expressions. Distinguishing happiness and pride may be facilitated by attending to the mouth, in particular the difference between open smiles with teeth and closed mouth smiles. Finally, Study 4 examined EEG changes (ERPs) to isolated mouth images depicting grimaces, open mouths and smiles, both with and without teeth, finding larger amplitudes and faster latencies for early ERP components for expressions featuring teeth. Collectively, these four studies offer modest support for a discrete emotions theory: that happiness and pride each represent an emotion category characterized by distinct nonverbal expressions and corresponding trait associations. Moreover, regarding the happiness superiority effect, these studies are consistent with other investigations articulating the visual salience of happiness. These findings are discussed in the context of the larger emotion perception literature.

First, we introduce a framework for automatically inferring the travel modes and trip purposes of human movement when tracked by a GPS device. We utilize a multiple changepoints algorithm to divide trajectories into segments using only speed data. Then, Random Forest is used to classify segments into moving and not-moving types. For moving segments, travel mode (car, bus, train, walk, and bike) is predicted. Next, multiple machine learning algorithms are employed, validated, and tested to identify the most suitable model for inferring trip purposes. The overall accuracy for prediction is over 80% on the testing set, both with and without data on socio-demographic variables. The model also predicts ""shop"" trips with an accuracy of 92.1%, while its accuracy for ""go home"" and ""studying"" trips reaches 100%. Additionally, we utilize the classification results in the first stage of research to compare households' travel patterns from before a new light rail transit line began service to two periods of time after service began. Our results indicate that, although the average of activity duration varies significantly over days of week and waves, the random effect of these two factors on activity duration was minor; time of day contributed over one third of the total variance in the duration. Finally, the dissertation demonstrates uses of Twitter data as a potentially important data source to understand comments, criticisms, and responses about light rail in Los Angeles. The results of information flow analysis, sentiment estimation, topic modeling, and its application can be useful for exploring trends among commuters and how their sentiment changed according to the light rail line they used, the time of day, and the day of the week.

My investigations focus on knowledge transfer and innovation related firm responses with an emphasis on firms' especially, Multinational Enterprises' (MNEs) market strategies such as ownership, governance and location choices and their non-market strategies such as political networking and stakeholder management. I'm particularly interested in emerging countries and the changing institutional environment in those contexts. To study changes occurring in different speeds and varying firm responses to them, I have hand-collected longitudinal datasets for different industries and employed both qualitative and quantitative methodologies: my datasets covers both moderately-dynamic industries such as multinational construction and retailing and as well as more knowledge-intensive industries such as multinational pharmaceutical, electronics and computer & software industries. Chapter 1: MNE Legitimacy in the Eyes of the People: Insights from Libya about Surviving Association with an Overthrown Regime In the first chapter, I investigate how firms respond to changes that are less-anticipated and takes place in a rapid fashion. Differentiating between the learning that MNEs accumulate at the host-countries and related learning they transfer from similar locations, this paper is built upon and extend theories about how MNEs, cope with institutional voids and transitions in relation to their political connections, corporate social responsibility strategies and interactions with stakeholders in the emerging countries. In order to do so, I conducted an in-depth qualitative study on how different MNEs with different interaction levels to the Gaddafi Regime, society, tribes and the new government in Libya were affected by the Arab Spring. In this paper, using the Arab Spring as a natural experiment and employing Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) and Fuzzy-set methodology, we build new theory on how MNEs can survive and even thrive during times of fast institutional transitions. We introduce ""the legitimacy of the government"" as an alternative measure of host-country political environment assessment and suggest that MNEs that deepened, broadened and expanded their political connections and strategies to multiple political actors and complemented them with CSR related activities fare better major institutional changes at the host countries. In addition, the results suggest that host-country only specific learning can lock-in MNEs not to see the changing ""tea leaves"" if they don't complement it with their recent related experiences from their operations other countries. Chapter 2: The Effect of Different Post-Entry Experiences on Changing Market Entry Choices The second chapter focuses on post-entry operations of multinational retail firms that are required to offer a standardized service for an effective knowledge redeploying, but also need to recombine their HQ knowledge with the knowledge that the subsidiaries possess, to ensure adaptation to the local conditions at the same time. The change, now being the multiple uncertainties related with multinational retail chains' internationalization into different locations, I first analyze how these firms decide on efficient firm boundaries and positioning after their entry into the host countries, and then investigate effects of these post-entry choices on their performance at the host-countries. Constructing a novel data-set of MNEs post-entry commitments in the host countries, my study reviews MNEs' behavior after they have entered a foreign country and individually tracks their alteration of its ownership and retail format changes over time within that country starting from 1975 and until 2013.

"8HSIUT3B","thesis","2016","Mance, Irida","The contribution of alpha oscillations to working memory processing","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1812931256?accountid=14026","Working memory, which enables the temporary storage of information in an active ""online"" state, is an exceptionally capacity limited system. Given this capacity limit, irrelevant information in our environment must be filtered out, while relevant representation is maintained. Research has shown that neural oscillations in the alpha frequency range (8-12Hz) are greatly influenced by the number of items in memory. Most work has argued that alpha oscillations primarily support working memory processing by suppressing information that could interfere with items already in memory, as indexed by an increase in alpha power. However, other work has shown that decreases in alpha power, with little evidence of concurrent increases, support the maintenance of working memory representations. In this thesis we show that, in the context of visual working memory, the primary role of alpha oscillations is to maintain distinct working memory representations, rather than to suppress irrelevant information. This is shown in a series of three experiments all indicating that as the number of relevant items increases, the power of alpha oscillations systematically decreases. In the first experiment, we use a whole report and change detection task to examine how the number of items in memory influences alpha oscillations. In the second experiment, we use a cuing (Experiment 2A) and filtering (Experiment 2B) paradigm to demonstrate that alpha power tracks the number of remembered items instead of the number of total items on the screen. Lastly, by presenting items sequentially (Experiment 3A) or in overlapping locations (Experiment 3B), we see evidence that decreases in alpha power are related to the maintenance of relevant spatial locations, instead of the number of items in memory. The results of the experiments suggest that alpha power reflects the maintenance of relevant working memory representations, rather than the suppression of irrelevant external distractors or the inhibition of task-irrelevant neural areas. Furthermore, our last experiment indicates that the alpha frequency band is especially sensitive to the maintenance of spatial information.

"K3IJ7H9H","thesis","2016","Miller, Benjamin","The making of knowledge-makers in composition: A distant reading of dissertations","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1817568637?accountid=14026","Combining qualitative coding with original algorithmic and quantitative analyses, this project aggregates and visualizes metadata from 2,711 recent doctoral dissertations in Composition/Rhetoric, completed between 2001 and 2010 (inclusive), in order to establish an empirical baseline of what new and established scholars in Composition/Rhetoric agree upon as acceptable research in the field. I find that both subject matter and methodologies largely collocate within a small number of clusters, but not without cross-over among these clusters, and I call for increased dialogue among schools focusing on these different methods and subjects. Chapter 1, ""Disciplinary Anxiety and the Composition of Composition,"" reviews the history of Composition/Rhetoric's search for a shared research paradigm, including its potential rejection of that goal. Following Derek Mueller (2009), I argue for ""distant reading"" (Moretti), through metadata visualization, as a means of keeping abreast of research trends that would be unmanageable through direct reading alone. Chapter 2, ""From Dissertations to Data: My Exhibits and My Methods,"" explains how I obtained, selected, and prepared the 2,711 documents that go into my subsequent analysis. Chapter 3, ""Mapping the Methods of Composition/Rhetoric Dissertations: A 'Landscape Plotted and Pieced,' "" takes up the question of whether the field has divided along methodological lines, as Stephen North (1987) predicted. After identifying methods used in dissertations based on their abstracts, I describe correlations between dissertation methods and the graduate schools where they are most frequently employed. Most dissertations used more than one method. I demonstrate that, while aggregable and empirical methods have not disappeared, few schools focus on them; dialectical and text-hermeneutic methods are far more common across the board. Chapter 4, ""Tapping the Topics: What We Study When We Study Writing in Writing Studies,"" turns from methods to content. Drawing on a computer-generated topic model of the full text of 1,754 dissertations, I provide evidence both for high-level clustering of topics and for large numbers of dissertations that cut across these clusters. The most common dissertation topics in this sample address the teaching of writing and, in a largely separate cluster, theories of meaning-making. In Chapter 5, ""Toward a View From Everywhere: 'Disciplined Interdisciplinarity' and Distant Reading,"" I reflect on the benefits and limitations of the methods I have used, and suggest directions for future study. Although it is generally clear to doctoral students preparing to begin dissertation work that they have a number of methods to choose from, and a number of ways to construct and usefully constrain their subject matter, Composition/Rhetoric as a field has not generally speaking kept good track of trends across institutions, with the result that individual dissertation-writers do not know whether a particular method or subject they are considering is common or quirky, cutting-edge or passe. By offering a recent, zoomed-out view beyond the vantage point of any one program, these analyses provide a shared map of where Composition/Rhetoric doctoral research has been, so that researchers, thesis committees, and curriculum-planners can make more informed local decisions about where their research should go next.

With the population rapidly aging, it is expected that 1 out of 3 Americans will have diabetes by 2050. Mobile devices and mobile applications have the potential to contribute to diabetes self-care by allowing users to manage their diabetes by keeping track of their blood glucose levels. Usability is important for systems that help people self-manage conditions such as diabetes. Age and diabetes-related cognitive decline might intensify the impact of usability issues for the users who need these mobile applications the most. As highlighted by usability researchers, the context of use (i.e. environment, user, task, and technology) has a significant impact on usability. The environment (lighting, temperature, audio and visual distractions, etc.) is of special interest to the mobile usability arena since in the case of mobile devices, is always changing. This dissertation aims to support the claim that context and more specifically environmental distraction such as semantic auditory distractions impact the usability of mobile applications. In doing so, it attempts to answer the following research questions: 1) Does semantic auditory distractions reduce the effectiveness of a blood glucose tracking mobile application? 2) Does semantic auditory distractions reduce the efficiency of a blood glucose tracking mobile application? 3) Does semantic auditory distractions reduce the user satisfaction of a blood glucose tracking mobile application? To answer the study research questions, a true experimental design was performed involving 30 adults with type 2 diabetes. Participants were paired based on their age and experience with smartphones and randomly assigned to the control (no semantic auditory distractions) or experimental (semantic auditory distractions) group. Research questions were tested using the general linear model. The results of this study confirmed that semantic auditory distractions have a significant effect on efficiency and effectiveness, and hence they need to be taken into account when evaluating mobile usability. This study also showed that semantic auditory distractions have no significant effect on user satisfaction. This dissertation enhances the current knowledge about the impact of semantic auditory distractions on the usability of mobile applications within the diabetic senior population.

Online learners may be not sufficiently prepared for the level of collaboration fluency expected by a globally competitive digital distributed knowledge economy. This is largely due in part by how collaboration technologies is used towards impacting learning goals and outcomes in practice by online learners themselves or by deliberate instructional design of the online environment. The purpose of this design-based research study was three-fold: (1) examine collaboration by exploring the perceptions of adult online learners regarding collaboration technology use and of a series instructional intervention videos that supported tool use; (2) track the iterative design, development, implementation, and evaluation of instructional screencasts designed to demonstrate and support the use of dynamic text editor functions and multimedia features for authentic collaboration learning tasks and learner-driven discussion board communication in two online discussion forum platforms: Blackboard Learn (BB) and Google Groups (GG); and (3) determine the impact of the instructional intervention on our educational problem identified as a behavior: organic learner-driven online discussion board collaboration. Participants were purposive sample of online learners enrolled in five graduate-level instructional technology online courses. Quantitative survey and qualitative reflective journal data was gathered in a three phased feedback loop. Findings indicated that collaboration is first a mindset supported not only by collaboration technology tools or learner technological self-efficacy, but by deliberate instructional design mediated by the cultural environment and the social context of the activity system.

For instance, conference organizers can use expert search capability while forming a panel for reviewing papers. Similarly, recruiters can use expert search to track potential employees for their companies. Although significant progress has been made on this problem, existing models for expert search are not tailored for academic domains. In academic domains, expert search and similar expert finding involve ranking researchers in response to topic and name queries based on academic documents. Academic or research documents are different from webpages in terms of their type (e.g., homepages, publications, grant proposals), structure (e.g., abstract, sections), associated metadata (e.g., venue, authors) and connections (e.g., citations). Enabling expert search in an open-access digital library such as CiteSeer is challenging since academic documents are not directly available for estimating expertise. Instead, CiteSeer acquires freely-available publications and other relevant academic documents by crawling the Web. Previous studies indicate that researchers list their publication information online using their homepages since this substantially increases the impact of their work. It becomes imperative, therefore, to periodically track researcher homepage URLs in CiteSeer for obtaining up-to-date collections of academic documents. In addition to their use as a resource for academic documents, professional homepages of researchers also typically include descriptions of research interests and other metadata that is crucial in tasks such as author disambiguation and profile extraction. Despite several studies on homepage finding in the context of the general web, academic homepage finding is not fully addressed in existing research. The first question we address in this dissertation is: how can we acquire an accurate homepage collection? We study this question in two settings. First, we study academic homepage finding on the Web. Given the results of web search for a researcher name query, our goal is to identify the correct homepage in the set of pages retrieved from the Web. We design features based on insights from content analysis of known academic homepages to learn a ranking function for academic homepage retrieval. In the second setting, we address homepage finding on university department websites where academic homepages need to be discriminated from other kinds of academic webpages. Despite training the classifier on ""outdated"" webpage instances, we show that unlabeled data and multiple views of webpages can be used to adapt our classifier to current-day academic websites. In the second part of this dissertation, we address expert search for academic domains. We study ranking models for researchers in response to topic and name queries. We use the content of research documents and the structural connections among documents to build query-dependent graphs for scoring researchers. We propose a simple extension to PageRank for combining evidence from multiple types of documents. This model scores researchers based on the structural connections among the documents and the importance of each document-type. In addition, we propose Author-Document-Topic graphs for scoring researchers based on the topical content of documents generated by them. Our models handle name and topic queries uniformly and show state-of-the-art retrieval performance on expert finding tasks.

"AKJGQ8PC","thesis","2016","Ling, Guang","Learning to improve recommender systems","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1830078223?accountid=14026","With the rapid development of e-commerce websites, music and video streaming websites and social sharing websites, users are facing an explosion of choices nowadays. The presence of unprecedentedly large amount of choices leads to the information overload problem, which refers to the difficulty a user faces in understanding an issue and making decisions that are caused by the presence of too much information. Recommender systems learn users' preferences based on past behaviors and make suggestions for them. These systems are the key component to alleviate and solve the information overload problem. Encouraging progress has been achieved in the research of recommender systems from neighborhood-based methods to model-based methods. However, recommender systems employed today are far from perfect. In this thesis, we propose to improve the recommender systems from four perspectives motivated by real life problems. First and foremost, we develop online algorithms for collaborative filtering methods, which are widely applicable to recommender systems. Traditionally batch-training algorithms are developed for collaborative filtering methods. They enjoy the advantage of easy to understand and simple to implement. However, the batch-training algorithms fail to consider the dynamic scenario where new users and new items join the system constantly. In order to make recommendations for these new users and on these new items, batch-training algorithms need to re-train the model from scratch. During the training process of batch-training algorithms, all the data have to be processed in each iteration. This is prohibitively slow given the sheer size of users and items faced by a real recommender system. Online learning algorithms can solve both of the problems by updating the model incrementally based on a rating point. Secondly, we question an assumption made implicitly by most recommender systems. Most existing recommender systems assume that the rating distribution of collected ratings and that of the unobserved ratings are the same. Using data collected from a real life recommender system, we show that this assumption is unlikely to be true. By employing the powerful missing data theory, we develop a model that drops this unrealistic assumption and makes unbiased predictions. Thirdly we examine the spam problem confronted by recommender systems. The ratings assigned by spam users contaminate the data of a recommender system and lead to deteriorated experience for normal users. We propose to use a reputation estimation system to keep track of users' reputations and identify spam users based on their reputations. We develop a unified framework for reputation estimation that subsumes a number of existing reputation estimation methods. Based on the framework, we also develop a matrix factorization based method that demonstrates outstanding discrimination ability. Lastly, we integrate content-based filtering with collaborative filtering to alleviate the cold-start problem. The cold-start problem refers to the situation where a system has too little information concerning a user or an item to make accurate recommendations. With the readily available rich information embedded in review comments, which are generally discarded, we can alleviate the cold-start problem. Additionally, we can tag the black box collaborative filtering algorithm with interpretable tags that help a recommender system to provide reasons on why items are being recommended. In summary, we solve some of the major problems faced by recommender systems and improve them from various perspectives in this thesis. Extensive experiments on real life large-scale datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed models.

"9L28ZYU7","thesis","2016","Borchert, Otto Jerome","Harnessing user generated multimedia content in the creation of collaborative classification structures and retrieval learning games","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1832253456?accountid=14026","This paper describes a software tool to assist groups of people in the classification and identification of real world objects called the Classification, Identification, and Retrieval-based Collaborative Learning Environment (CIRCLE). A thorough literature review identified current pedagogical theories that were synthesized into a series of five tasks: gathering, elaboration, classification, identification, and reinforcement through game play. This approach is detailed as part of an included peer reviewed paper. Motivation is increased through the use of formative and summative gamification; getting points completing important portions of the tasks and playing retrieval learning based games, respectively, which is also included as a peer-reviewed conference proceedings paper. Collaboration is integrated into the experience through specific tasks and communication mediums. Implementation focused on a REST-based client-server architecture. The client is a series of web-based interfaces to complete each of the tasks, support formal classroom interaction through faculty accounts and student tracking, and a module for peers to help each other. The server, developed using an in-house JavaMOO platform, stores relevant project data and serves data through a series of messages implemented as a JavaScript Object Notation Application Programming Interface (JSON API). Through a series of two beta tests and two experiments, it was discovered the second, elaboration, task requires considerable support. While students were able to properly suggest experiments and make observations, the subtask involving cleaning the data for use in CIRCLE required extra support. When supplied with more structured data, students were enthusiastic about the classification and identification tasks, showing marked improvement in usability scores and in open ended survey responses. CIRCLE tracks a variety of educationally relevant variables, facilitating support for instructors and researchers. Future work will revolve around material development, software refinement, and theory building. Curricula, lesson plans, instructional materials need to be created to seamlessly integrate CIRCLE in a variety of courses. Further refinement of the software will focus on improving the elaboration interface and developing further game templates to add to the motivation and retrieval learning aspects of the software. Data gathered from CIRCLE experiments can be used to develop and strengthen theories on teaching and learning.

Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine if the presence of MCR increases the risk of falls in older people. Methods: Individual participant data ( n = 6,204) from five longitudinal studies from three countries were used for this analysis. MCR diagnosis was defined as both the presence of objectively measured slow gait speed and subjective cognitive complaints in those without dementia or mobility disability. Falls were prospectively ascertained using phone calls or questionnaires. Log binomial regression was performed to determine if MCR increased the risk of falls separately in each cohort. Random effects meta-analysis was used to pool results from all cohorts. Results: The mean age of participants was 74.9 (SD 6.8) years and 44% ( n = 2728) were male. Overall 33.9% ( n = 2104) reported a fall over follow-up. Pooled relative risk of MCR with any falls was RR 1.44 95% CI 1.16, 1.79. The components of MCR, slow gait (RR 1.30 95% CI 1.14, 1.47) and cognitive complaint (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07, 1.46) were also associated with an increased risk of any falls. In sub-analyses MCR was associated with any fall independent of previous falls (RR 1.29 95% CI 1.09, 1.53) and with multiple falls (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.25, 2.51). Conclusion: MCR is associated with an increased risk of falls. The increase in risk was higher than for its individual components. The simplicity of the MCR makes it an attractive falls risk screening tool for the clinic.

Unfortunately, this increase in cognitive load, which is often conceptualized as increased listening effort, may come at the cost of cognitive processing resources that might otherwise be available for other tasks. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the independent and combined effects of a hearing aid directional microphone and a noise reduction (NR) algorithm on reducing the listening effort older listeners with hearing loss expend on a speech-in-noise task. Research Design: Participants were fitted with study worn commercially available behind-the-ear hearing aids. Listening effort on a sentence recognition in noise task was measured using an objective auditory‐visual dual-task paradigm. The primary task required participants to repeat sentences presented in quiet and in a four-talker babble. The secondary task was a digital visual pursuit rotor-tracking test, for which participants were instructed to use a computer mouse to track a moving target around an ellipse that was displayed on a computer screen. Each of the two tasks was presented separately and concurrently at a fixed overall speech recognition performance level of 50% correct with and without the directional microphone and/or the NR algorithm activated in the hearing aids. In addition, participants reported how effortful it was to listen to the sentences in quiet and in background noise in the different hearing aid listening conditions. Study Sample: Fifteen older listeners with mild sloping to severe sensorineural hearing loss participated in this study. Results: Listening effort in background noise was significantly reduced with the directional microphones activated in the hearing aids. However, there was no significant change in listening effort with the hearing aid NR algorithm compared to no noise processing. Correlation analysis between objective and self-reported ratings of listening effort showed no significant relation. Conclusions: Directional microphone processing effectively reduced the cognitive load of listening to speech in background noise. This is significant because it is likely that listeners with hearing impairment will frequently encounter noisy speech in their everyday communications.

Yet questions remain regarding staff preparedness, instructional and pedagogical transformation, and impact on student achievement with this increased use of mobile technologies in primary and secondary classrooms. This evaluation was part of a professional development series that was implemented with K-6 teachers in the process of implementing new mobile technologies into classroom instruction. This professional development series provided a number of formal, informal, and impromptu opportunities for staff to learn new tools and practices for technology integration, as well as provide occasions to share and reflect upon technology employment practices. A key component to the series was the use of the concerns-based adoption model to track teachers' questions and concerns and to adjust the training accordingly. This evaluation report was prepared to provide an overview of the variety of training sessions that were implemented, to document changes that were made based on feedback from staff, and to recommend appropriate modifications and goals for continuation of the professional development series. The overall evaluation data collected indicated evidence supporting the success of this model. Furthermore, there was strong evidence that participants had positive perceptions of the workshops, activities, and support provided through this model.

This chapter presents a technical approach that exploits the congruence of emotions raised by music and places to identify music tracks that match a place of interest (POI). Such technique can be used in location-aware music recommendation services. For instance, a mobile city guide may play music related to the place visited by a tourist, or an in-car navigation system may adapt music to places the car is passing by. We address the problem of matching music to places by employing a controlled vocabulary of emotion labels. We hypothesize that the commonality of these emotions could provide, among other approaches, the base for establishing a degree of match between a place and a music track, i.e., finding music that ""feels right"" for the place. Through a series of user studies we show the correctness of our hypothesis. We compare the proposed emotion-based matching approach with a personalized approach where the music track is matched to the music preferences of the user, and to a knowledge-based approach which matches music to places based on metadata (e.g., matching music that was composed during the same period that the place of interest was built in). We show that when evaluating the goodness of fit between places and music, personalization is not sufficient and that the users perceive the emotion-based music suggestions as better fitting the places. The results also suggest that emotion-based and knowledge-based techniques can be combined to complement each other.

The research methods and applied theories are also identified and analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: Three large databases, namely, ScienceDirect, EBSCOhost and Google Scholar, were selected to search for published articles (i.e. 107 empirical articles and 15 review/policy articles) related to China’s outbound tourism. Thereafter, the retrieved articles were categorized and analyzed. Finally, a theoretical framework was provided for future studies on China’s outbound tourism. Findings: The major findings indicated that the main topics related to China’s outbound tourism included market segmentation, travel motivation and travel behavior. One or two theories are generally applied to investigate a certain topic. The most common research methods are interviews and a questionnaire survey. Research limitations/implications: Future studies are suggested to apply more theories to investigate one topic. A single theory can also be applied to investigate different topics.

"ZVP62XLB","thesis","2016","Hales, Sarah B.","Refinement and pilot testing social networks for encouraging healthy behaviors: The social pounds off digitally (social POD) study","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1865271632?accountid=14026","Currently about 71% of adults in the US are considered overweight or obese. Overweight and obesity are associated with higher risk of developing many chronic diseases; however, health risks associated with overweight and obesity can be reduced by as little as a 3% to 5% reduction in weight. Mobile health (mHealth) has shown promise as a way to deliver weight loss interventions, yet maintaining participant engagement over time has been a challenge. The purpose of this study was to develop, refine, and pilot test the Social Pounds Off Digitally (POD) Android app for personalized health monitoring and interaction; revise the Social POD app based on participant feedback; and conduct a multi-site randomized clinical trial to pilot test the second iteration of the Social POD app. Overweight and obese adults with Android smartphones (BMI 25-49.9 kg/m2; N=9) were recruited for a two-month weight loss pilot intervention and iterative usability testing of the Social POD app. The app prompted participants via notification to track daily weight, diet, and PA behaviors. Participants received the content of the behavioral weight loss intervention via podcast. In order to re-engage infrequent users, the app prompted frequent app users to select one of three messages to send to infrequent users targeting one of three behavioral theory constructs: 1) social support, 2) self-efficacy, or 3) negative outcome expectations. Body weight and dietary intake (two 24-hr recalls) were assessed at baseline and two months. All participants attended one of two focus groups to provide feedback on use of the app. Based on the usability testing, the Social POD app was refined and a point-based incentive system was incorporated into the app and used in a larger randomized controlled trial. Overweight and obese adults (N=51, mean BMI=34.7 +/- 6.0, 38% black) in Charleston and Columbia, SC who owned an Android phone or tablet were recruited to participate in a 12-week behavioral weight loss intervention delivered via mobile app and podcast. All participants received the behavioral content of the weight loss intervention via twice weekly podcasts and were randomized to download and use either a standard calorie tracking app (Fat Secret) or the Social POD app. Main outcomes included kilograms lost at 12-weeks and secondary outcomes included change in psychosocial variable scores from pre- to post-test, association between points earned and percent weight loss at 12-weeks, and re-engagement based on message-type received. Following the usability testing participants lost a mean of -0.94 kg (+/-2.22 kg, p=0.24) and consumed significantly fewer kcals post-intervention (1570+/-508 kcal/day) as compared to baseline (2384+/-993 kcal/day, p=0.01). Mean number of app entries was 77.2 +/- 73.8 per person with a range of 2 to 219. Messages selected and sent to infrequent users targeting social support were sent most frequently (n=32, 46%), followed by self-efficacy (n=29, 40%), and negative outcome expectations (n=10, 14%). Themes from the focus groups included functionality issues, revisions to the messaging system, and the addition of a point system with rewards for achieving goals. Participant attrition for the RCT was 12% (n=3 experimental and n=3 comparison). Experimental group participants lost significantly more weight (-5.3kg, CI: -7.5, -3.0) than comparison group participants (-2.23kg, CI: -3.6, -1.0; p=0.02) and had a greater reduction in BMI (p=0.02). These outcomes were significant for both intention-to-treat (using baseline observation carried forward) and complete case. While there were significant differences in final positive outcome expectations scores between groups [4.56 experimental, 3.57 comparison (scale range from 1 to 7, maximum); p=0.04], other secondary outcomes (e.g., caloric intake and social support) were not significantly different by group assignment.

Methods: The Community Noise and Health Study, a cross-sectional epidemiological study, included an in-house computer-assisted interview and sleep pattern monitoring over a 7 d period. Outdoor WTN levels were calculated following international standards for conditions that typically approximate the highest long-term average levels at each dwelling. Study data were collected between May and September 2013 from adults, aged 18–79 y (606 males, 632 females) randomly selected from each household and living between 0.25 and 11.22 kilometers from operational wind turbines in two Canadian provinces. Self-reported sleep quality over the past 30 d was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Additional questions assessed the prevalence of diagnosed sleep disorders and the magnitude of sleep disturbance over the previous year. Objective measures for sleep latency, sleep efficiency, total sleep time, rate of awakening bouts, and wake duration after sleep onset were recorded using the wrist worn Actiwatch2® from a subsample of 654 participants (289 males, 365 females) for a total of 3,772 sleep nights. Results: Participant response rate for the interview was 78.9%. Outdoor WTN levels reached 46 dB(A) with an arithmetic mean of 35.6 and a standard deviation of 7.4. Self-reported and objectively measured sleep outcomes consistently revealed no apparent pattern or statistically significant relationship to WTN levels. However, sleep was significantly influenced by other factors, including, but not limited to, the use of sleep medication, other health conditions (including sleep disorders), caffeine consumption, and annoyance with blinking lights on wind turbines. Conclusions: Study results do not support an association between exposure to outdoor WTN up to 46 dB(A) and an increase in the prevalence of disturbed sleep. Conclusions are based on WTN levels averaged over 1 y and, in some cases, may be strengthened with an analysis that examines sleep quality in relation to WTN levels calculated during the precise sleep period time.

Design/methodology/approach: By having a thorough literature review on the said Web 2.0 and HR functions’ concepts, the study develops a conceptual model with seven propositions that assist in answering two major research questions, i.e., whether Web 2.0 tools can benefit the four major functions of human resource management (HRM), and to what extent Web 2.0 tools help HR Managers to reap maximum (efficiently and effectively) out of four major functions of HRM. By identifying the possible gaps in use of Web 2.0 tools and HR functional performance, the study identifies potential areas of future research for the upcoming researcher and industry practitioners. Findings: HR 2.0 regime (right alignment of Web 2.0 tools and HR functions) will allow both the ends (employee and employer) to drive the organization toward sustainable, long-term business success. Excellence in HR functions following the HR 2.0 concept, can lead the organizations get best desired HR and business outcomes across sectors and industries. Though using Web 2.0 tools in HR functions can encounter various challenges as management of bulky information, time wastage, personal conflicts, threats of losing information confidentiality, etc., but these potential threats can be made less risky by transforming organization culture. Research limitations/implications: As the scope of the study was limited to the use of Web 2.0 tools in HR practices, the study provided a generic view of the use of Web 2.0 tools in HR domain. Thus the findings should be used only in HR domain in a variety of contexts. Practical implications: The current study adds value to in the exploration of the link between Web 2.0 and HRM in a systematic way because of the fact that Web 2.0 tools as drivers or facilitating tools can play a vital role in execution of HR practices and processes in a secure, effective and efficient manner. The current study also paves the way for the HR practitioners and researcher to extract manifold benefits from the use of Web 2.0 tools in all of its functions with the right understanding. Critical role of HR can be favorably facilitated by Web 2.0 in favor of both, i.e., employees and the employers which could ultimately enable them to create a competitive edge in the market place. The organizations in general (whether private or public, manufacturing or public, small and medium enterprises or MNEs) can extract the real benefits from the right use of Web 2.0 while performing any of their HR function. Enhanced decision making may also be gained using the right mix of Web 2.0 tools and HR practices in any organization. The study also provides a track to the researchers to excavate more associations among the said constructs and to test these relationships in different industries so that maximum HR challenges may be addressed related to the employee and the HR process. Social implications: Social implications of the current study can be derived as the main focus is HR practices which are executed by the employees, who if are positively addressed, may gain economic and social up gradations. As for the employers use of Web 2.0 tools in their HR functions not only will bring economic prosperity for themselves but for the employees and the society. Originality/value: Conceptual analysis of links between the use of Web 2.0 tools and HR functions to draw the attention of HR practitioners to benefit both employers and employees. Though the use of Web 2.0 is being popular in various other business areas but not for internal employees regarding HR functions. Paper provides the conceptual link of Web 2.0 applications, i.e., blogs, wikis, folksonomies, RSS, podcasts and online social networks with human resource functions.

Purpose: This study tested a performance feedback-based app compared to a game-based app to examine their effects on aspects of immediate response to an exercise bout. Methods: Twenty-eight participants completed a 30-min treadmill run while using one of two randomly assigned mobile running apps: Nike + Running, a performance-monitoring app which theoretically induces an associative, goal-driven state, or Zombies Run!, an app which turns the experience of running into a virtual reality game, theoretically inducing dissociation from primary exercise goals. Results: The two conditions did not differ on primary motivational state outcomes; however, participants reported more associative attentional focus in the performance-monitoring app condition compared to more dissociative focus in the game-based app condition. Conclusions: Game-based and performance-tracking running apps may not have differential effects on goal motivation during exercise. However, game-based apps may help recreational exercisers dissociate from exercise more readily. Increasing the enjoyment of an exercise bout through the development of new and innovative mobile technologies is an important avenue for future research.

Within this context, we focus on respondent multitasking (RM) in web surveys. RM occurs when users engage in other activities while responding to a web survey questionnaire. The conceptual framework is built on existing literature on multitasking, integrating knowledge from both cognitive psychology and survey methodology. Our main contribution is a new approach for measuring RM in web surveys, which involves an innovative use of the different types of paradata defined as non-reactive electronic tracks concerning respondents' process of answering the web questionnaire. In addition to using questionnaire page completion time as a measure of RM, we introduce ‘focus-out’ events that indicate when respondents have left the window containing the web questionnaire (e.g., to chat, email, browse) and then returned. The approach was tested in an empirical study using a web survey on a student sample (n = 267). The results indicate that 60% of respondents have multitasked at least once. In addition, they reveal that item nonresponse as an indicator of response quality is associated with RM, while non-differentiation is not. Although this study confirms that a paradata-based approach is a feasible means of measuring RM, future research on this topic is warranted.

In the original article, the units on the y-axes of Figure 3, D and E, were incorrectly labeled as ΔF/F₀. The y-axes should instead be labeled as F/F min. The corrected Figure 3 with its legend is present in the erratum and in the online PDF version of the article.] Optical imaging of voltage indicators based on green fluorescent proteins (FPs) or archaerhodopsin has emerged as a powerful approach for detecting the activity of many individual neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution. Relative to green FP-based voltage indicators, a bright red-shifted FP-based voltage indicator has the intrinsic advantages of lower phototoxicity, lower autofluorescent background, and compatibility with blue-light-excitable channelrhodopsins. Here, we report a bright red fluorescent voltage indicator (fluorescent indicator for voltage imaging red; FlicR1) with properties that are comparable to the best available green indicators. To develop FlicR1, we used directed protein evolution and rational engineering to screen libraries of thousands of variants. FlicR1 faithfully reports single action potentials (∼3% ΔF/F) and tracks electrically driven voltage oscillations at 100 Hz in dissociated Sprague Dawley rat hippocampal neurons in single trial recordings. Furthermore, FlicR1 can be easily imaged with wide-field fluorescence microscopy. We demonstrate that FlicR1 can be used in conjunction with a blue-shifted channelrhodopsin for all-optical electrophysiology, although blue light photoactivation of the FlicR1 chromophore presents a challenge for applications that require spatially overlapping yellow and blue excitation.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of a home‐based active video game intervention on objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour in children at risk for DCD. Methods: In a crossover randomized clinical trial, 21 children (mean age 11.0, SD 1.0;  n = 11 girls) in Perth, Western Australia participated in two 16‐week periods: no active video games (AVGs) control period and AVGs intervention period. Two active input consoles were provided to participants along with a selection of non‐violent AVGs for participants to play at home. Participants wore accelerometers at baseline and following each period to determine minutes of sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous times in addition to self‐reported types of activities in a diary. Linear mixed models, adjusted for the order of periods, compared physical activity and sedentary time during the last week of each period. Results: There were no significant differences between the intervention and control periods in time spent in sedentary (decrease of −1.0 min/day during the intervention period, 95% CI−12.1, 10.1), light (increase of 2.2 min/day, 95% CI−8.8, 13.2), moderate (decrease of 0.7 min/day, 95%CI −4.6, 3.3) or vigorous (decrease of −0.6 min/day, 95%CI −1.6, 0.4). Conclusions: Among children at risk for DCD, participating in this AVG intervention did not improve objectively measured physical activity and sedentary time.

The medium of communication is email. Aims: The aim of the paper is to understand the email usage patterns of PWA. Methods & Procedures: We evaluated the email program in two ways, i.e., by analysing the AVN email server logs and by collecting subjective responses through questionnaires. The log data that we analysed were over 4 years (2007–2010). Outcomes & Results: Our results indicate that both PWA and therapists find the email program useful, despite the fact that they expressed several criticisms about its usability. We have found from the log results that there were three types of users utilising the email program. Group 1 registered to use the program but never used it; Group 2 started using the program after registration and after some time stopped using it. And finally Group 3 is still active in email exchange but the frequency is rather low. In total there were 326 users (146 PWA and 180 persons who did not have aphasia) who generated email messages; 119 PWA sent email messages. A small number of the PWA (6 out of 119) sent messages without receiving them, while the majority (113 out of 146) of them sent and received messages. Of the 9996 email messages sent (from July 2007 to December 31, 2010), 80.1% (8010) email messages were sent by PWA and 19.9% (1986) email messages were sent by persons who did not have aphasia. It is a good sign that the majority of the email messages were sent by PWA, as they are the primary users of the social network site. It has also been revealed from the data analysis that overall only 10% of the messages contain image attachments. Conclusions: Even though several design aspects need to be considered to improve the program, the current design is a promising first step. The lessons learned from the evaluation of the AVN email program can be helpful for designing social networking sites for other people with disabilities.

The original article is retracted due to evidence indicating that the peer review of this paper was compromised. It is believed that the paper was accepted based on recommendations from reviewers with conflicts of interest. In addition, ISI provided the publisher with evidence of inappropriate manipulation of citations. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2013-37585-007). The newly developed marketing channel of electronic commerce (EC) is different from traditional channels and has been promoted by the government for a period of time. In EC, integrated information is not only provided to the enterprises involved but the procedures needed for trade are fewer, promoting environmentally friendly practices. It has, however, caused great variation in the business environment. The e‐invoice plays a vital role in keeping track of cash and business information, and its implementation will help to convert the whole supply chain to electronic form and lower overall operational costs. At present, e‐invoices are only used in certain situations such as for online shopping, for electronic purchases by suppliers, in value‐added networks, and so on. They are not applied in daily life or used by the public. However, a mobile e‐invoice system can be designed to connect the e‐invoice to the Web for the ordinary user. In this era of the mobile interactive Internet use, where individual computers interact with one another, this will help in the application of many kinds of network and real‐life services.

This study introduces a method for the evaluation of information ergonomics in knowledge work. To this end, five key dimensions of information ergonomics were identified: contextual factors of knowledge work, multitasking, interruptions at work, practices for managing information load, and perceived job control and productivity. In total, 24 measures focusing on the above dimensions were constructed. The measures include, for example, the number of fragmented work tasks per work day. The measures were preliminarily tested in two Finnish organisations, making use of empirical data gathered by interviews, electronic questionnaires and log data applications tracking work processes on personal computers. The measures are applicable to the evaluation of information ergonomics, even though individual measures vary with regard to the amount of work and time needed for data analysis.

Although self-report data indicate that low SEP individuals use the Internet less than high SEP people for health information and for other beneficial capital-enhancing activities, these results may not provide an accurate overall view of online use. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the ways in which low SEP individuals use the Internet, including for entertainment, social networking, and capital-enhancing functions, and how they are associated with health information seeking. Methods: Detailed Web tracking data were collected from 118 low SEP individuals who participated in the intervention group of a randomized controlled trial that provided Internet access. Websites were grouped by topic, including categories of capital-enhancing websites that provided access to resources and information. Different types of online activities were summed into an Internet use index. Single and multiple negative binomial regression models were fitted with the Internet use index as the predictor and health information seeking as the outcome. Next, models were fitted with low, medium, and high Web usage in capital-enhancing, entertainment, and social network categories to determine their associations with health information seeking. Results: Participants used the Web for diverse purposes, with 63.6% (75/118) accessing the Internet for all defined types of Internet use. Each additional category of Internet use was associated with 2.12 times the rate of health information seeking (95% CI 1.84-2.44,  P < .001). Higher use of each type of capital-enhancing information was associated with higher rates of health information seeking, with high uses of government (incident rate ratio [IRR] 8.90, 95% CI 4.82-16.42, P < .001) and news (IRR 11.36, 95% CI 6.21-20.79, P < .001) websites associated with the highest rates of health information seeking compared to their lowest use categories. High entertainment website use (IRR 3.91, 95% CI 2.07-7.37, P < .001) and high social network use (IRR 2.06, 95% CI 1.08-3.92, P = .03) were also associated with higher health information seeking. Conclusions: These data clearly show that familiarity and skills in using the Internet enhance the capacity to use it for diverse purposes, including health and to increase capital, and that Internet usage for specific activities is not a zero sum game. Using it for one type of topic, such as entertainment, does not detract from using it for other purposes. Findings may inform ways to engage low SEP groups with Internet resources.

However, the response burden of (self-report) EMA limits its clinical utility. Objective: The aim was to explore mobile phone-based unobtrusive EMA, in which mobile phone usage logs are considered as proxy measures of clinically relevant user states and contexts. Methods: This was an uncontrolled explorative pilot study. Our study consisted of 6 weeks of EMA/unobtrusive EMA data collection in a Dutch student population (N = 33), followed by a regression modeling analysis. Participants self-monitored their mood on their mobile phone (EMA) with a one-dimensional mood measure (1 to 10) and a two-dimensional circumplex measure (arousal/valence, -2 to 2). Meanwhile, with participants’ consent, a mobile phone app unobtrusively collected (meta) data from six smartphone sensor logs (unobtrusive EMA: calls/short message service (SMS) text messages, screen time, application usage, accelerometer, and phone camera events). Through forward stepwise regression (FSR), we built personalized regression models from the unobtrusive EMA variables to predict day-to-day variation in EMA mood ratings. The predictive performance of these models (ie, cross-validated mean squared error and percentage of correct predictions) was compared to naive benchmark regression models (the mean model and a lag-2 history model). Results: A total of 27 participants (81%) provided a mean 35.5 days (SD 3.8) of valid EMA/unobtrusive EMA data. The FSR models accurately predicted 55% to 76% of EMA mood scores. However, the predictive performance of these models was significantly inferior to that of naive benchmark models. Conclusions: Mobile phone-based unobtrusive EMA is a technically feasible and potentially powerful EMA variant. The method is young and positive findings may not replicate. At present, we do not recommend the application of FSR-based mood prediction in real-world clinical settings. Further psychometric studies and more advanced data mining techniques are needed to unlock unobtrusive EMA’s true potential.

Method: Literature was identified from Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and our documentation centre, and contacting 71 railway companies, resulting in 716 articles and eight unpublished reports, with 94 having empirical data on 55 unique studies. Research quality was critically assessed. Results: The quality of studies varies greatly with frequent shortcomings: no justification of sample size, lacking information on the reliability and validity of measures, no explanation nor theoretical understanding of findings. Railway suicides resemble closely people who use other methods, although they tend to be younger. As with other suicide methods, mental health problems are likely to be present. Railway suicide attempters usually die, but most urban transportation systems attempters survive. Railway suicides are rarely impulsive; people usually go to the railway for the purpose of killing themselves. Hotspots have been the focus of some prevention measures. We know little about why people choose railway suicide, but studies of survivors suggest they often thought they would have an immediate, certain and painless death. Media reports on railway suicides can increase their incidence. Conclusions: Most research focuses on the incidence and characteristics of events and attempters. Research has not shown that railway suicides are different from suicides by other means. Better quality research is needed, particularly studies that investigate why people use railways to kill themselves and how railway suicides can be effectively prevented, as well as more evaluations of prevention programmes. Because of significant variations by country and region in characteristics of railway suicides, prevention programmes should conduct a local assessment of the characteristics of attempters and incidents. Practical implications: We need more research on indicators of suicide risk in attempters on railway property, and studies of how suicidal people on railway property are prevented from suicide. Changing beliefs and attitudes about railway suicides, reducing media reports, offering help onsite, controlling access at hotspots and better staff training in mental health facilities near tracks are promising prevention strategies. However, local specificities must be considered in planning prevention strategies.

We used a life history theoretical perspective to investigate whether early life experiences (stable vs. unstable family environments) influence what women find attractive in a potential mate. Using an online face perception task, women reported perceptions of traits and attraction to male faces. Life history strategy was operationalized in 2 ways: (a) the Mini-K Short Form self-report measure and (b) the contact or absence of a father during childhood. We hypothesized that women employing a faster life history strategy would be more attracted to men who have facial features reflecting more masculine traits, which have been linked to testosterone and signal high genetic quality. We also hypothesized that women employing a slower life history strategy would be more attracted to men who have facial features reflecting traits associated with high parental investment. Consistent with our hypothesis, those on a faster life history track rated masculine male faces as more attractive (β = .13,  p < .001), and those employing a slower life history strategy reported more attraction to men with high feminine traits (β = .31, p < .001). This suggests that women employing a faster life history strategy favor men who show signs of high genetic quality (masculine traits) and little cues of parental investment, possibly subjecting these women to adverse life and relationship outcomes. Strategies for more precisely studying the link between life history and mate selection are discussed.

Seven participants underwent four experimental sessions while measuring brain activity with magnetoencephalograpy. The first three sessions were of a simple constrained task in which the participant was to pull back on the control stick to recover from a perturbation in attitude in one condition and to passively observe the perturbation in the other condition. The fourth session consisted of having to recover from a perturbation in attitude while piloting the plane through the Grand Canyon constantly maneuvering to track over the river below. Independent component analysis was used on the first two sessions to extract artifacts and find an event related component associated with the onset of the perturbation. These two sessions were used to train a decoder to classify trials in which the participant recovered from the perturbation (motor intention) vs. just passively viewing the perturbation. The BCI-decoder was tested on the third session of the same simple task and found to be able to significantly distinguish motor intention trials from passive viewing trials (mean = 69.8%). The same BCI-decoder was then used to test the fourth session on the complex task. The BCI-decoder significantly classified perturbation from no perturbation trials (73.3%) with a significant time savings of 72.3 ms (Original response time of 425.0–352.7 ms for BCI-decoder). The BCI-decoder model of the best subject was shown to generalize for both performance and time savings to the other subjects. The results of our off-line open loop simulation demonstrate that BCI based neuroadaptive automation has the potential to decode motor intention faster than manual control in response to a hazardous perturbation in flight attitude while ignoring ongoing motor and visual induced activity related to piloting the airplane.

In the original article there were some errors. The corrections are given in the erratum. The authors provide corrections to the first author's affiliation, email, and author background.] Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have recently taken center stage in discussions surrounding online education, both in terms of their potential as well as their high dropout rates. The high attrition rates associated with MOOCs have often been described in terms of a scale-efficacy tradeoff. Building from the large numbers associated with MOOCs and the ability to track individual student performance, this study takes an initial step towards a mechanism for the early and accurate identification of students at risk for dropping out. Focusing on struggling students who remain active in course discussion forums and who are already more likely to finish a course, we design a temporal modeling approach, one which prioritizes the at-risk students in order of their likelihood to drop out of a course. In identifying only a small subset of at-risk students, we seek to provide systematic insight for instructors so they may better provide targeted support for those students most in need of intervention. Moreover, we proffer appending historical features to the current week of features for model building and to introduce principle component analysis in order to identify the breakpoint for turning off the features of previous weeks. This appended modeling method is shown to outperform simpler temporal models which simply sum features. To deal with the kind of data variability presented by MOOCs, this study illustrates the effectiveness of an ensemble stacking generalization approach to build more robust and accurate prediction models than the direct application of base learners.

In stage 1 of a three-stage study, participants ( N = 15) reported emotional states associated with best, worst and ideal performance. Results indicated that a best and ideal emotional state for performance composed of feeling happy, calm, energetic and moderately anxious whereas the worst emotional state for performance composed of feeling downhearted, sluggish and highly anxious. In stage 2, emotion regulation interventions were developed using online material and supported by electronic feedback. One intervention motivated participants to increase the intensity of unpleasant emotions (e.g. feel more angry and anxious). A second intervention motivated participants to reduce the intensity of unpleasant emotions (e.g. feel less angry and anxious). In stage 3, using a repeated measures design, participants used each intervention before running a 1600 m time trial. Data were compared with a no treatment control condition. The intervention designed to increase the intensity of unpleasant emotions resulted in higher anxiety and lower calmness scores but no significant effects on 1600 m running time. The intervention designed to reduce the intensity of unpleasant emotions was associated with significantly slower times for the first 400 m.

The precision and accuracy of the data being collected can vary depending on the focus, concentration, mood, and experience of a researcher, and this can generate errors in data collection that can influence the results. We present a software for counting leaf-cutting ants that tracks the number of ants on previously recorded videos. The software was developed in the Python language and uses an image processing library called OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision). It is based on a low-resolution video (640 × 480 pixels) taken with a camera mounted on a tripod and orientated perpendicularly to the ground. This open access program uses the movement of ants to identify their position and track them. It counts the number of ants that pass through a given point in two directions with respect to the nest entrance: incoming and outgoing. Comparisons between AntCounter and conventional methods used to count ants show that the program has higher accuracy than traditional counting in real time while reducing data collection time. We also report the error in the data collected by AntCounter. Using AntCounter the researcher reduces both the time of data collection in the field and the time to process data. It is also possible to improve the sampling effort (e.g., increase the number of samples, the number of experimental units), and measure the ants for longer periods of time, and at lower prices.

The studied prototype warning application functions on a smart phone. The novelty of the application is its proactive and context-sensitive approach to the adjustment of warning thresholds according to the estimated visual demands of the driving situation ahead. In our study, novice and experienced drivers conducted in-car tasks with a smart phone on a test track with and without the warnings. The application gave a warning if the driver's gaze was recognized to remain on the smart phone over a situation-specific threshold time, or if the driver was approaching a high-demand part of the track (an intersection or a tight curve). Glance metrics indicated a significant increasing effect of the warnings on glance time on road while multitasking. The effect varied between 5% and 30% increase depending on the in-car task. A text message reading task was the most visually demanding activity and indicated the greatest effect of the warnings on glance time on road. Driving experience did not have an effect on the efficiency of the warnings. The proposed gaze tracking with current smart phone technology proved to be highly unreliable in varying lighting conditions. However, the findings suggest that location-based proactive distraction warnings of high-demanding driving situations ahead could help all drivers in overcoming the inability to evaluate situational demands while interacting with complex in-car tasks and to place more attention on the road. Furthermore, survey results indicate that it is possible to achieve high levels of trust, perceived usefulness, and acceptance with these kinds of context-sensitive distraction warnings for drivers.

Recently, the role of affect in influencing and regulating health behaviors received more attention. Affects as internal cues may automatically activate unconscious processes of behavior regulation. The aim of our study was to examine the association between affect and physical activity in daily life. In addition, we studied the influence of the habit of being physically active on this relationship. An ambulatory assessment study in 89 persons (33.7% male, 25 to 65 years,  M = 45.2, SD = 8.1) was conducted. Affect was assessed in the afternoon on 5 weekdays using smartphones. Physical activity was measured continuously objectively using accelerometers and subjectively using smartphones in the evening. Habit strength was assessed at the beginning of the diary period. The outcomes were objectively and subjectively measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) performed after work. Multilevel regression models were used to analyze the association between affect and after work MVPA. In addition, the cross-level interaction of habit strength and affect on after work MVPA was tested. Positive affect was positively related to objectively measured and self-reported after work MVPA: the greater the positive affect the more time persons subsequently spent on MVPA. An inverse relationship was found for negative affect: the greater the negative affect the less time persons spent on MVPA. The cross-level interaction effect was significant only for objectively measured MVPA. A strong habit seems to strengthen both the positive influence of positive affect and the negative influence of negative affect. The results of this study confirm previous results and indicate that affect plays an important role for the regulation of physical activity behavior in daily life. The results for positive affect were consistent. However, in contrast to previous reports of no or an inverse association, negative affect decreased subsequent MVPA. These inconsistencies may be—in part—explained by the different measurements of affect in our and other studies. Therefore, further research is warranted to gain more insight into the association between affect and physical activity.

In this Article, the accompanying web-linked appendix was published with track changes.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-18901-001). BACKGROUND: More than 30 million people are released from prison worldwide every year, who include a group at high risk of perpetrating interpersonal violence. Because there is considerable inconsistency and inefficiency in identifying those who would benefit from interventions to reduce this risk, we developed and validated a clinical prediction rule to determine the risk of violent offending in released prisoners. METHODS: We did a cohort study of a population of released prisoners in Sweden. Through linkage of population-based registers, we developed predictive models for violent reoffending for the cohort. First, we developed a derivation model to determine the strength of prespecified, routinely obtained criminal history, sociodemographic, and clinical risk factors using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression, and then tested them in an external validation. We measured discrimination and calibration for prediction of our primary outcome of violent reoffending at 1 and 2 years using cutoffs of 10% for 1-year risk and 20% for 2-year risk. FINDINGS: We identified a cohort of 47 326 prisoners released in Sweden between 2001 and 2009, with 11 263 incidents of violent reoffending during this period. We developed a 14-item derivation model to predict violent reoffending and tested it in an external validation (assigning 37 100 individuals to the derivation sample and 10 226 to the validation sample). The model showed good measures of discrimination (Harrell's c-index 0·74) and calibration. For risk of violent reoffending at 1 year, sensitivity was 76% (95% CI 73–79) and specificity was 61% (95% CI 60–62). Positive and negative predictive values were 21% (95% CI 19–22) and 95% (95% CI 94–96), respectively. At 2 years, sensitivity was 67% (95% CI 64–69) and specificity was 70% (95% CI 69–72). Positive and negative predictive values were 37% (95% CI 35–39) and 89% (95% CI 88–90), respectively. Of individuals with a predicted risk of violent reoffending of 50% or more, 88% had drug and alcohol use disorders. We used the model to generate a simple, web-based, risk calculator (OxRec) that is free to use. INTERPRETATION: We have developed a prediction model in a Swedish prison population that can assist with decision making on release by identifying those who are at low risk of future violent offending, and those at high risk of violent reoffending who might benefit from drug and alcohol treatment. Further assessments in other populations and countries are needed. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust, the Swedish Research Council, and the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare.

Technology represents an attractive medium for the delivery of weight control interventions focused on college students, given its reach and appeal among this population. However, few technology-mediated weight gain prevention interventions have been evaluated for college students. Objective: This study examined a new teclmology-based, social media-facilitated weight gain prevention intervention for college students. Methods: Undergraduates ( n = 58) in two sections of a public university course were allocated to either a behavioral weight gain prevention intervention (Healthy Weight, HW; N = 29) or a human papillomav irus (HPV) vaccination awareness intervention (control; N = 29). All students were enrolled, regardless of initial body weight or expressed interest in weight management. The interventions delivered 8 lessons via electronic newsletters and Facebook postings over 9 weeks, which were designed to foster social support and introduce relevant educational content. The HW intervention targeted behavioral strategies to prevent weight gain and provided participants with a Wi-Fi-enabled scale and an electronic physical activity tracker to facilitate weight regulation. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted to examine within- and between-group differences in measures of self-reported weight control practices and objectively measured weight. Use of each intervention medium and device was objectively tracked, and intervention satisfaction measures were obtained. Results: Students remained weight stable (HW: -0.48 + 1.9 kg; control: -0.45 + 1.4 kg), with no significant difference between groups over 9 weeks ( P =.94). However, HW students reported a significantly greater increase in the number of appropriate weight control strategies than did controls (2.1 + 4.5 vs -1.1 + 3.4, respectively; P = .003) and there was no increase in inappropriate weight control behaviors ( P =. 11). More than 90% of students in the HW arm opened the electronic newsletters each week, and the average number of Facebook interactions (comments and likes) per student each week was 3.3 + 1.4. Each self-monitoring device was initialized by 90% of HW students. On average, they used their physical activity tracker for 23.7+15.2 days and their Wi-Fi scale for 14.1 + 13.1 days over the 9 weeks. HW students rated the intervention favorably. Conclusions: The short-term effect of this technology-based weight gain prevention intervention for college students is promising and merits evaluation over a longer duration to determine whether engagement and behavioral improvements positively affect weight outcomes and can be maintained.

Adaptive systems strive to find the right balance in a spectrum that spans between self-control and system-guidance. They also concern a smoother shifting of the balance point during learning episodes in light of competing requirements from learning goals, learner capacity, instructional affordances, and educational theories, among others. This research investigates one of the extremes of this spectrum, where learners actively assume control and take responsibility for their own learning, while catering to individual preferences with little or no guidance from the e-learning environment. In this study, one unit material from an online Introduction to Java Programming course has been redesigned based on the proposed Learner-Directed Model for the experimental design study. The model is developed based on the exploration of two educational theories—Experiential-Learning Theory (ELT) and Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) Theory. The study involved a total of 35 participants ( N = 35) divided randomly into one Experimental Group and one Control Group. They were assigned to either a Learner-Directed Model (Experimental Group) or a linear model (Control Group). Pre/post tests, survey, follow-up interview as well as log file analysis were instruments used for assessing students’ domain knowledge, meta-knowledge, and their attitudes for their overall learning experience. The results of the study have revealed that there is a statistically significant higher level of overall learning experience and better learning attitudes compared to Control Group students who studied with e-learning components that are linear in nature and are without explicit associations with educational theories.

Patients are increasingly expected to be informed participants and to be able to make conscious decisions, which they often find very difficult. In an attempt to support patients with malignant lymphoma in clinical communication, we developed a stand-alone, Web-based intervention called “PatientTIME.” The development of PatientTIME was based on a participatory intervention mapping framework. Its primary aim is to boost patients’ self-efficacy in patient-professional communication (ie, their confidence when interacting with their HCP). Patients can use this intervention before their hospital visit to prepare for their clinical consultation. PatientTIME is fully automated and use is patient-initiated. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate if and in what way patients benefit from PatientTIME and if it enhances their confidence in clinical communication. Methods: The intervention was evaluated in a closed randomized controlled trial with continuous recruitment (using online and offline methods to reach potential participants) and data collection. In accordance with the Medical Research Council guidance, we started with a process evaluation. Subsequently, an outcome evaluation was performed focusing on the patients’ perceived confidence in communication with their HCP, measured with the validated PEPPI questionnaire at baseline and at 3 months after participation. Process and outcome data were obtained through Web-based questionnaires, log files (automatically generated files mapping the interactions between program and users), and a logbook (comprising a record of actions and interactions kept by the researchers). Participants were not blinded. A total of 146 patients registered online, of whom 97 gave their informed consent and were assigned at random to the control group (N = 34) or 1 of the 2 intervention groups (N = 63). Ultimately 87/97 (90%) of these patients actually participated in the study, producing 87 datasets for analysis. Results: More than half of the intervention group patients reported that the intervention helped them prepare for a clinical consultation; it created awareness about the importance of communication and reinforced their existing communication skills. In the postvisit test, the control group showed a small, nonsignificant improvement in perceived communication efficacy. The intervention group showed a significant improvement in perceived efficacy. However, the interaction effect was not significant, indicating that the improvement solely as a result of the intervention may not be significant. Conclusions: A considerable number of patients reported that PatientTIME did provide support. We found a trend indicating that in the long run, patients with access to PatientTIME scored better on the perceived efficacy scale than patients without access. However, at this stage we cannot conclude that PatientTIME improves patients’ confidence when interacting with HCPs.

For the empirical study, data were obtained from 105 university students who were enrolled in two blended learning courses that used AOD as their main activity. The results indicated the high accuracy of the prediction model as well as the possibility of early detection and timely interventions.

However, methodological limitations currently make large-scale assessment of children’s attentional skill impractical, costly and lacking in ecological validity. Consequently we developed a measure of ‘Visual Motor Attention’ (VMA)—a construct defined as the ability to sustain and adapt visuomotor behaviour in response to task-relevant visual information. In a series of experiments, we evaluated the capability of our method to measure attentional processes and their contributions in guiding visuomotor behaviour. Experiment 1 established the method’s core features (ability to track stimuli moving on a tablet-computer screen with a hand-held stylus) and demonstrated its sensitivity to principled manipulations in adults’ attentional load. Experiment 2 standardised a format suitable for use with children and showed construct validity by capturing developmental changes in executive attention processes. Experiment 3 tested the hypothesis that children with and without coordination difficulties would show qualitatively different response patterns, finding an interaction between the cognitive and motor factors underpinning responses. Experiment 4 identified associations between VMA performance and existing standardised attention assessments and thereby confirmed convergent validity. These results establish a novel approach to measuring childhood attention that can produce meaningful functional assessments that capture how attention operates in an ecologically valid context (i.e. attention's specific contribution to visuomanual action).

Experimental studies may help identify the causal mechanisms underlying low social standing as a pathway for obesity. Our objective was to investigate the effects of experimentally manipulated social status on ad libitum acute dietary intakes and stress-related outcomes as potential mechanisms relating social status and weight. This was a pilot feasibility, randomized, crossover study in Hispanic young adults ( n = 9; age 19–25; 67% female; BMI ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 30 kg/m²). At visit 1, participants consumed a standardized breakfast and were randomized to a high social status position (HIGH) or low social status position (LOW) in a rigged game of Monopoly™. The rules for the game differed substantially in terms of degree of ‘privilege’ depending on randomization to HIGH or LOW. Following Monopoly™, participants were given an ad libitum buffet meal and energy intakes (kcal) were estimated by pre- and post-weighing foods consumed. Stress-related markers were measured at baseline, after the game of Monopoly™, and after lunch. Visit 2 used the same standardized protocol; however, participants were exposed to the opposite social status condition. When compared to HIGH, participants in LOW consumed 130 more calories ( p = 0.07) and a significantly higher proportion of their daily calorie needs in the ad libitum buffet meal (39% in LOW versus 31% in HIGH; p = 0.04). In LOW, participants reported decreased feelings of pride and powerfulness following Monopoly™ ( p = 0.05) and after their lunch meal ( p = 0.08). Relative to HIGH, participants in LOW demonstrated higher heart rates following Monopoly™ ( p = 0.06), but this relationship was not significant once lunch was consumed ( p = 0.31). Our pilot data suggest a possible causal relationship between experimentally manipulated low social status and increased acute energy intakes in Hispanic young adults, potentially influenced by decreased feelings of pride and powerfulness. Increased energy intake over time, resulting in positive energy balance, could contribute to increased risk for obesity, which could partially explain the observed relationship between low social standing and higher weight. Larger and longitudinal studies in a diverse sample need to be conducted to confirm findings, increase generalizability, and assess whether this relationship persists over time.

Considerable research studies are carried out in order to apprehend how effective and usable e-learning systems. In this paper, an empirical-based study is conducted to explore how lecturers interact with an e-learning environment based on a predefined task model describing low-level interactions. Client-side log data is collected from university lecturers from the Electrical and Computer Science departments. Subsequently, data analysis is conducted to infer the usability degree from the estimated usage metrics together with further exploratory analysis from user feedback via System Usability Scale. Experimental results reveal that the System Usability Scale score is not a sufficient measure to express the true acceptance and satisfaction level of lecturers for using the e-learning systems. The evaluation must be fulfilled in tandem with analyzing the usage metrics derived from interaction traces in a non-intrusive fashion. The proposed approach is a milestone towards usability evaluation to improve the acceptance and user experience for academic staff and students.

In this, they evoke manifest sequences of overt behavior that are stored in computer-generated log files. In the present study, we explored the relation between several overt behaviors, which  N = 1476 Finnish ninth-grade students (mean age = 15.23, SD = .47 years) exhibited when exploring a CPS environment, and their CPS performance. We used the MicroDYN approach to measure CPS and inspected students' behaviors through log-file analyses. Results indicated that students who occasionally observed the problem environment in a noninterfering way in addition to actively exploring it (noninterfering observation) showed better CPS performance, whereas students who showed a high frequency of (potentially unplanned) interventions (intervention frequency) exhibited worse CPS performance. Additionally, both too much and too little time spent on a CPS task ( time on task) was associated with poor CPS performance. The observed effects held after controlling for students' use of an exploration strategy that required a sequence of multiple interventions (VOTAT strategy) indicating that these behaviors exhibited incremental effects on CPS performance beyond the use of VOTAT.

A systematic review","Journal of Medical Internet Research","","1439-4456, 1439-4456","10.2196/jmir.5461","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1861208552?accountid=14026","Background: Computer-based learning (CBL) has been widely used in medical education, and reports regarding its usage and effectiveness have ranged broadly. Most work has been done on the effectiveness of CBL approaches versus traditional methods, and little has been done on the comparative effects of CBL versus CBL methodologies. These findings urged other authors to recommend such studies in hopes of improving knowledge about which CBL methods work best in which settings. Objective: In this systematic review, we aimed to characterize recent studies of the development of software platforms and interventions in medical education, search for common points among studies, and assess whether recommendations for CBL research are being taken into consideration. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature published from 2003 through 2013. We included studies written in English, specifically in medical education, regarding either the development of instructional software or interventions using instructional software, during training or practice, that reported learner attitudes, satisfaction, knowledge, skills, or software usage. We conducted 2 latent class analyses to group articles according to platform features and intervention characteristics. In addition, we analyzed references and citations for abstracted articles. Results: We analyzed 251 articles. The number of publications rose over time, and they encompassed most medical disciplines, learning settings, and training levels, totaling 25 different platforms specifically for medical education. We uncovered 4 latent classes for educational software, characteristically making use of multimedia (115/251, 45.8%), text (64/251, 25.5%), Web conferencing (54/251, 21.5%), and instructional design principles (18/251, 7.2%). We found 3 classes for intervention outcomes: knowledge and attitudes (175/212, 82.6%), knowledge, attitudes, and skills (11.8%), and online activity (12/212, 5.7%). About a quarter of the articles (58/227, 25.6%) did not hold references or citations in common with other articles. The number of common references and citations increased in articles reporting instructional design principles ( P = .03), articles measuring online activities ( P = .01), and articles citing a review by Cook and colleagues on CBL ( P = .04). There was an association between number of citations and studies comparing CBL versus CBL, independent of publication date ( P = .02). Conclusions: Studies in this field vary highly, and a high number of software systems are being developed. It seems that past recommendations regarding CBL interventions are being taken into consideration. A move into a more student-centered model, a focus on implementing reusable software platforms for specific learning contexts, and the analysis of online activity to track and predict outcomes are relevant areas for future research in this field.

The aim of this study was to pilot a survey to explore patterns of behavioral tracking using smartphone lifestyle apps and individuals' willingness to share their app-generated data. Methods: A cross-sectional Web-based survey was conducted within a university setting. The 35-item survey asked participants about their self-tracking patterns; use of lifestyle apps and wearable devices; how their self-tracked health data could be useful to them; and any restrictions they would impose on sharing personal data. Responses were tabulated and analyzed for trends. Results: The survey was completed by 101 participants. On average, 3.1 (standard deviation [SD] ± 1.9) health and fitness apps were installed by current app users ( n = 85), with MyFitnessPal, MapMyRun, Nike +, and Fitbit being most popular. Most participants were willing to share their personal health data for research (77%). Those who did not normally share their health-tracking data were more likely than sharers to be concerned about privacy (odds ratio [OR] = 5.93; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 2.09–16.78), as were those not identifying with the quantified-self movement compared with those who were (OR = 5.04; 95% CI = 1.64–15.50). Discussion: Participants were generally willing to share personal data, thus increasing the potential for these data to inform public health research and for use in targeted personalized program and intervention development. Conclusions: Opportunities for partnerships between researchers and commercial app developers or industry could improve public health research and practice.

Using the insights derived from their activity trackers, individuals are expected to be more empowered to set and stick to personal health goals. Whereas the outcome of using activity trackers is of great importance to both individuals and society at large, there are no empirical studies substantiating this presumption. This study aims to contribute to filling this research gap. Making use of self-regulation theory as theoretical framework, we developed a model that proposes six system specific elements (attractiveness, monitoring, feedback, privacy protection, readability, and gamification) as determinants of health empowerment, and thereof health commitment. Using survey data collected from individuals wearing smart wristbands ( N = 210), the model was validated. Overall, the results provide strong support for the health empowering capabilities of smart wristbands. The paper concludes with implications for theory and practice, and some suggestions for future research.

Methods: Patients (N = 141) receiving a new prescription at one internal medicine clinic were recruited into a 2-arm physician-randomized study. We leveraged an EHR platform to automatically deliver 1-page educational ‘MedSheets’ to patients after medical encounters. We also assessed if physicians counseled patients via patient self-report immediately following visits. Patients’ understanding was objectively measured via phone interview. Results: 122 patients completed the trial. Most intervention patients (70%) reported receiving MedSheets. Patients reported physicians frequently counseled on indication and directions for use, but less often for risks. In multivariable analysis, written information (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.10–7.04) and physician counseling (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.26–6.91) were independently associated with patient understanding of risk information. Receiving both was most beneficial; 87% of those receiving counseling and MedSheets correctly recalled medication risks compared to 40% receiving neither. Conclusion: An EHR can be a reliable means to deliver tangible, print medication education to patients, but cannot replace the salience of physician-patient communication. Practice implications: Offering both written and spoken modalities produced a synergistic effect for informing patients.

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate the ASPIRE Coaching Fidelity Checklist (ACFC). Classical test theory guided ACFC development. Principal component analyses were used to determine item groupings. Psychometric properties, internal consistency, and inter-rater reliability were evaluated for each subscale. Criterion validity was tested by predicting weight loss as a function of coaching fidelity. The final 19-item ACFC consists of two domains (session process and session structure) and five subscales (sets goals and monitor progress, assess and personalize self-regulatory content, manages the session, creates a supportive and empathetic climate, and stays on track). Four of five subscales showed high internal consistency (Cronbach alphas > 0.70) for group-based coaching; only two of five subscales had high internal reliability for phone-based coaching. All five sub-scales were positively and significantly associated with weight loss for group- but not for phone-based coaching. The ACFC is a reliable and valid instrument that can be used to assess fidelity and guide skill-building for weight management interventionists.

Objective: This study examined relationships among diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived metrics and with behavioral changes in stroke patients with and without BCI training. Methods: Stroke patients ( n = 19) with upper extremity motor impairment were assessed using Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Nine-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT), and DTI scans. Ten subjects completed four assessments over a control period during which no training was administered. Seventeen subjects, including eight who completed the control period, completed four assessments over an experimental period during which subjects received interventional BCI training. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were extracted from each corticospinal tract (CST) and transcallosal motor fibers for each scan. Results: No significant group by time interactions were identified at the group level in DTI or behavioral measures. During the control period, increases in contralesional CST FA and in asymmetric FA (aFA) correlated with poorer scores on SIS and 9-HPT. During the experimental period (with BCI training), increases in contralesional CST FA were correlated with improvements in 9-HPT while increases in aFA correlated with improvements in ARAT but with worsening 9-HPT performance; changes in transcallosal motor fibers positively correlated with those in the contralesional CST. All correlations p < 0.05 corrected. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the integrity of the contralesional CST may be used to track individual behavioral changes observed with BCI training after stroke.

Methods: The N-CAPS system was designed through the application of various computer vision and artificial intelligence algorithms that allows the system to track a user during a specific assembly task, and then provide verbal and visual prompts to the worker as needed. A pilot study was completed with the N-CAPS solution in order to investigate whether it was an appropriate intervention. Four participants completed the required assembly task five different times, using the N-CAPS system. Results: The participants completed all of the trials that they attempted with 85.7% of the steps completed without assistance from the job coach. Of the 85.7% of steps completed independently, 32.5% of these were completed in response to prompts given by N-CAPS. Overall system accuracy was 83.3%, the overall sensitivity was 86.2% and the overall specificity was 82.4%. Conclusions: The results from the study were positive in that they showed that this type of technology does have merit with this population. Implications for Rehabilitation: (i) It provides a concise summary of the importance of work in the lives of people with intellectual disabilities and how technology can support this life goal. (ii) It describes the first artificially intelligent system designed to support workers with intellectually disabilities. (iii) It provides evidence that individuals with intellectual disabilities can perform a work task in response to technology.

Understanding these attitudes can inform suicide prevention research, clinical practice, and policy. We aimed to develop such an instrument and to evaluate its psychometric properties using an active-duty military sample. Methods: A team of military personnel, suicidologists, and researchers assisted with item development. A cross-sectional design was used to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Military Suicide Attitudes Questionnaire (MSAQ) via an online survey battery. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. Results: A total of 317 military service members met eligibility criteria and completed the online surveys. A four-factor model that explained 46.4% of the variance was identified: (1) Individual-Based Rejection versus Acceptance; (2) Psychache versus Pathological; (3) Unit-Based Rejection versus Acceptance; (4) Moral versus Immoral. The MSAQ demonstrated high partial validity and test-retest reliability. Limitations: The study used a convenience sample and did not control for social desirability. Conclusions: The newly developed MSAQ is a promising measure that fills a notable gap in the assessment of suicide attitudes within the United States military. The MSAQ has the potential for future use in evaluating suicide prevention and stigma reduction programs within the Department of Defense. Additionally, the MSAQ may serve as a useful tool for leadership in the evaluation of command climates. In clinical settings, the MSAQ could be used along with other cognitive and attitudinal measures to track suicidal patients’ attitude towards suicide over the course of treatment.

We investigate the validity of simple questionnaires about sedentary behaviour (SB), (including the widely used proxy television (TV) viewing), and physical activity (PA) in comparison with objective measures. Methods: Community dwelling men aged 71–93 years, from a UK population-based cohort wore a GT3X accelerometer over the right hip for 7 days and self-completed a questionnaire including information about SB (TV, reading, computer use and car use) and PA (leisure and sporting domains). Results: 1566/3137 surviving men (mean age 79 years) attended. 1377 ambulatory men provided questionnaire and accelerometer data. Questionnaires under-estimated mean daily sedentary time; 317 minutes total SB (TV, computer use, reading or driving), 176 minutes (TV) vs 619 minutes (objectively measured). Correlations between objective measures and self-reports were 0.18 (total SB) and 0.17 (TV), both  P < 0.001. Objective SB levels were similar across the lowest three quartiles of self-reported SB but raised in the highest quartile. Correlations between steps/day or moderate to vigorous PA with self-reported total PA were both 0.49, P < 0.001 and measured PA levels were progressively higher at higher levels of self-reported PA. Conclusions: Among older men, simple SB questions performed poorly for identifying total SB time, although simple PA questions were associated with a graded increase with objectively measured PA. Future studies of health effects of SB in older men would benefit from objective measures of SB.

This study assessed weight bias in university students in the non-physician health professions. A convenience sample of 206 students completed an online survey composed of a validated 14- item scale (1-5 lowest to highest weight bias) and questions regarding personal experiences of weight bias. Respondents were grouped by discipline within graduate and undergraduate levels. Weight bias was present in a majority of respondents. Overall, the percentage of responses Indicative of weight bias was 92.7%. The mean total score was 3.65. ± 0.52, and the rating exceeded 3 for all 14 scale descriptors of high-weight people. In graduate students, discipline had a significant main effect on total score ( p = 0.01), with lower scores in dietetics (3.17 ± 0.46) vs audiology/sign language/speech language pathology (3.84 ± 0.41) and physician assistant students (3.78 ± 0.51; p < 0.05). These findings show that weight bias is prevalent in health professions students at a mountain west university. Well-controlled studies that track students into professional practice would help determine whether bias-reduction interventions in college improve provider behaviors and clinical outcomes.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-40566-010.) The sheer volume and complexity of publications in the biological sciences are straining traditional approaches to research planning. Nowhere is this problem more serious than in molecular and cellular cognition, since in this neuroscience field, researchers routinely use approaches and information from a variety of areas in neuroscience and other biology fields. Additionally, the multilevel integration process characteristic of this field involves the establishment of experimental connections between molecular, electrophysiological, behavioral, and even cognitive data. This multidisciplinary integration process requires strategies and approaches that originate in several different fields, which greatly increases the complexity and demands of this process. Although causal assertions, where phenomenon A is thought to contribute or relate to B, are at the center of this integration process and key to research in biology, there are currently no tools to help scientists keep track of the increasingly more complex network of causal connections they use when making research decisions. Here, we propose the development of semiautomated graphical and interactive tools to help neuroscientists and other biologists, including those working in molecular and cellular cognition, to track, map, and weight causal evidence in research papers. There is a great need for a concerted effort by biologists, computer scientists, and funding institutions to develop maps of causal information that would aid in integration of research findings and in experiment planning.

The purpose of this study is to report the effects of the ToyBox-intervention (a European 24-week cluster randomised controlled trial) on sedentary behaviour in preschoolers.Methods: In Belgium, 859 preschoolers from 27 kindergartens (15 intervention and 12 control) wore an accelerometer to objectively measure their sedentary time and 1715 parents/caregivers completed a questionnaire to assess sedentary activities in which preschoolers participate at home. Main outcomes were objectively measured sedentary time, time spent watching TV, using the computer and time spent in quiet play. Multilevel repeated measures analyses were conducted to take clustering into account. Intention to treat analysis was used to handle missing data.Results: A sample of 859 (29.5 % of all contacted children) preschoolers (4.4 ± 0.6 years, 54.4 % boys) provided valid accelerometer data at either baseline or follow-up and parents of 1715 (58.9 % of all contacted children) preschoolers (4.4 ± 0.5 years, 52.5 % boys) completed a questionnaire at either baseline or follow-up. No intervention effects were found on objectively and subjectively measured total sedentary time in the total sample. However, some effects on objectively and subjectively measured sedentary time were found in specific subgroups. Preschoolers from the intervention group from high SES kindergartens and preschoolers with high levels of sedentary time at baseline decreased their sedentary time, while preschoolers from the control group increased their sedentary time. Girls in the intervention group decreased their TV viewing time during weekend days (-5.83 min/day), while girls’ &TV viewing in the control group increased (+4.15 min/day). In low SES kindergartens, a smaller increase for computer time during weekend days was found in preschoolers in intervention kindergartens (+6.06 min/day) than in control kindergartens (+12.49 min/day).Conclusion: While some small positive effects were found in some sub-groups, the ToyBox-intervention had no effect on objectively and subjectively measured sedentary time in the total sample. A longer period to implement the intervention and a more active involvement of parents/caregivers might enhance intervention effects.

Efforts to train therapists in FAP have employed a parallel process, attempting to shape trainee behavior in an 8-week, live, online course in which trainees interact with each other in a series of experiential exercises. Previous research on the effects of this FAP training protocol have been hampered by reliance on trainee self-report and a lack of objective assessment of trainee behavior in actual sessions. In the current study, we developed and piloted an objective measure of FAP competency and employed it to assess outcomes in a FAP training study. Sixteen participants with a range of previous FAP training experiences were randomly assigned to an immediate FAP training or a waitlist-then-training group. Trainee self-report findings largely replicated findings from the previous study (Kanter, Tsai, Holman, & Koerner, 2012), with larger and more consistent effects found for trainees with fewer previous FAP training experiences. Objective assessment of in-session trainee behavior with the FAP Competency Scale suggested a significant effect of training, but these results were limited by missing data. These findings provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that engaging in a FAP training that functionally parallels the therapy process can enhance FAP therapist in-session competency.

An obstacle that may impede field development is lack of knowledge about influential works and authors to frame topical areas of inquiry and future research questions. We used citation analysis to track the development of BME research by uncovering 100 highly cited articles that revolve primarily around four research topical areas: (a) Entrepreneurship Education, (b) Distance Education/Online Teaching and Learning, (c) Business Student Ethics, and (d) Characteristics/Critiques of Business Schools. We then used legitimation code theory to categorize these articles on the basis of richness of knowledge ideas (Knowledge Code), the reputation of scholars (Knower Code), the combination of knowledge and reputation (Elite Code), or some other qualities (Relativist Code). Both Entrepreneurship Education and Online Teaching and Learning had articles in Relativist Code, Elite Code, and Knowledge Code categories, with other topical areas primarily populating the Knower Code and Relativist Code categories. We conclude by discussing potential implications for the development of BME research topics, BME scholars, and future applications of legitimation code theory.

It also evaluates clinicians’ ability to accurately self-assess their MI skills. Method: 34 clinicians participated in this study and completed MI workshops either in-person or online. Use of MI in an acting patient encounter was recorded early in the training and again following the training. Recordings of these encounters were coded using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) 3.1 coding system. After each acting patient encounter clinicians also self-evaluated their use of MI. Results: Participants showed statistically significant improvement in MI skills measured by the MITI. There were no meaningful differences between the MI skills acquired by the participants in the online group compared with those who completed training in-person. There was little correlation between participants’ self-assessment of MI skills and objective assessment. Discussion: It is feasible to complete MI training through synchronous online workshops. Participant self-assessment of MI skill does not appear to be a useful approach for assessing MI skill. The acquisition of MI skills by health professionals is possible via the Internet. Learning should be assessed using objective measures rather than relying on self-report.

However, the mechanisms by which screen time confers obesity risk remain unclear. Via community level recruitment this study examined whether the relationship between screen time behaviours and body mass index (BMI: kg/m²) was mediated by total energy intake or macronutrient consumption. In a cross-sectional study of post-pubertal adolescents (N = 283: 86M, 197F) with overweight or obesity at baseline of an intervention for weight control, we examined self-reported total energy intake (mean Calories from 3 day food diary), macronutrient intake (grams/day of carbohydrate, fat, protein) and total screen time (aggregate of hours/day watching TV, playing seated video games, and recreational computer use). BMI was objectively measured and converted to standardized scores (z-BMI). Simple and multiple mediation analyses were conducted using the bootstrapping approach described by Preacher and Hayes. Covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, parental education, Tanner stage, and self-reported physical activity. The relationship between screen time and z-BMI was significantly mediated by energy intake. Higher levels of carbohydrate intake, but not fat or protein intake, significantly mediated the relationship between screen time and z-BMI (95% bias-corrected and accelerated confidence interval [0.0004, 0.0074]). Higher carbohydrate intake mediated the relationship between TV viewing and z-BMI, and video gaming and z-BMI. In conclusion, the relationship between screen time and BMI appears to be mediated by increased energy intake, primarily in the form of higher carbohydrate intake. It is possible that reducing time spent watching TV and playing video games may reduce food intake and help promote dietary adherence needed for weight management in obese adolescents.

The authors provide corrections to the first author's affiliation, email, and author background. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-12704-013). Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have recently taken center stage in discussions surrounding online education, both in terms of their potential as well as their high dropout rates. The high attrition rates associated with MOOCs have often been described in terms of a scale-efficacy tradeoff. Building from the large numbers associated with MOOCs and the ability to track individual student performance, this study takes an initial step towards a mechanism for the early and accurate identification of students at risk for dropping out. Focusing on struggling students who remain active in course discussion forums and who are already more likely to finish a course, we design a temporal modeling approach, one which prioritizes the at-risk students in order of their likelihood to drop out of a course. In identifying only a small subset of at-risk students, we seek to provide systematic insight for instructors so they may better provide targeted support for those students most in need of intervention. Moreover, we proffer appending historical features to the current week of features for model building and to introduce principle component analysis in order to identify the breakpoint for turning off the features of previous weeks. This appended modeling method is shown to outperform simpler temporal models which simply sum features. To deal with the kind of data variability presented by MOOCs, this study illustrates the effectiveness of an ensemble stacking generalization approach to build more robust and accurate prediction models than the direct application of base learners.

Cohort instructors reported a high level of student engagement and felt that Pepper was more successful at supporting community than the previous commercial course management system. These findings inspired the current case study. What specific features and functionality of Pepper seemed to promote a deeper sense of community within these cohort-based environments, and why? The research questions were answered by collecting data from a variety of sources. First, in order to comprehend student/instructor online behaviours, automatically generated Pepper log files were examined. A survey was conducted to gather student opinions about different aspects of Pepper's functionality. Finally, students, instructors and the developer were interviewed to gather in-depth perspectives and experiences. Data analysis revealed that, contrary to expectations, Pepper was not used to conduct community-wide discussions, since most conversations took place daily during face-to-face classes. Instead, Pepper's perceived value was associated with its ease of use and its ability to i) share documents; ii) send and receive private messages; iii) make announcements; and iv) integrate calendars. Thus it complemented face-to-face community activities rather than replacing them. The research documented unconventional and innovative instructor uses of Pepper, including the hosting of multiple cohort groups in one shared environment and the use of a shared folder feature to foster overlapping cohort memberships. These behaviours mark a change from other course management systems where courses exist in separate online silos with no opportunity for interaction or collaboration. Logfiles revealed that private messaging was used more often than public postings, despite the environment's open format, raising questions about the possible importance of private discourse in communities. Finally, there was a perceived need for Pepper to be more accessible through smartphones to better support students' moment-by-moment need for information between and during classes. Recommendations are made relating to instructor and student training, full open access courses, additional tools and graphic representations. The concept of participatory presence is introduced as a new online cohort community framework.

"YUQQL4Y7","thesis","2017","Sunalai, Suravee","Knowledge management systems in higher education institutions in Thailand: A holistic model of enablers, processes, and outcomes","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870296841?accountid=14026","Higher education institutions (HEIs) have applied knowledge management (KM) to leverage organizational knowledge in support of their institutional achievements. HEIs need a holistic conceptualization of how KM processes dynamically interact with KM enablers and outcomes, but seem to typically lack an inclusive KM model. This research study aimed to develop and test a correlational model linking KM key enablers and processes to quality performance of HEIs. Data were collected using an online survey of 142 universities in Thailand with archival data. A key informant method was used with KM committee members serving as respondents. The 181 respondents from 60 universities voluntarily participated in the e-survey. After deleting inadmissible cases, 150 respondents were used as true response cases. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) constructed six scales describing KM enablers and processes: Technology, Strategic Context, Culture, Leadership with a Directive Role, Knowledge Transfer, and Knowledge Generation. Then, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that the hypothesized model with seven factors (six EFA scales and quality performance score) was acceptable based on the following fit indices (chi2 = 1581.515, df = 845, p < .001; CFI = .809; TLI = .795; RMSEA = .083, 90% CI: .077 -- .089; SRMR = .065). This hypothesized model adequately represented the actual data set. The thematic analyses from open ended questions provided emerging themes to support the hypothesized model that focuses on human-oriented enablers, including leadership, individual attitudes, and levels of KM understanding. This study revealed that knowledge becomes a process of individuals' insights, experiences, know-how, and values that are to be justified through social interactions among participants to make knowledge actionable and embedded in institutions' repositories and routines. Since knowledge requires dynamic management within each institution's system, KM provides the activity of creating and sharing knowledge across the whole system. HEIs require a dedicated position for KM oversight and need to find a way to enable members to participate in social interaction processes that make knowledge flow fluently throughout their institutions. With a well-organized KM system that consists of enablers, processes, and outcomes drawn from this study, KM will keep on track and stimulate individual, group, and organizational knowledge development and retention.

To improve upon current treatments, the interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors for loneliness and their effect on the brain must be better understood. The present study investigated the brain basis of loneliness in younger (mean age = 20.4) and older adults (mean age = 62.9). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and an emotional picture task to address this question. fMRI data were collected on a 3T Siemens Trio Scanner, with functional whole-brain images acquired using a gradient echo T2*-weighted EPI scan (TR = 2.5 s; TE = 30 ms; flip angle = 90; FOV = 256mm). 99 subjects (49 older, 50 younger) viewed pleasant and unpleasant social and non-social images in the scanner followed by completion of questionnaires including an objective measure of loneliness, the Social Network Index, and a subjective measure of loneliness, the UCLA loneliness scale. Saliva samples were collected for genotyping analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) that are associated with pair bonding and social behaviors. Questionnaire results indicated that older adults were significantly less lonely, anxious, shy, and depressed and had more frequent social contacts compared to younger adults. Eye tracking data demonstrated that older adults spent significantly more dwell time on faces while viewing both pleasant and unpleasant social images. Furthermore, older adults showed significantly greater activation in the fusiform gyrus during viewing of pleasant social images, even when controlling for differences in loneliness and gaze (p < 0.05, FWE corrected). These results support the positivity effect, which is a tendency among older adults to attend preferentially to positive information to increase their emotional satisfaction. Secondly, our genetic analyses demonstrated that individuals with the A/G genotype of the OXTR rs53576 SNP scored significantly higher on the shyness scale compared to G/G subjects (p < 0.005). Additionally, functional connectivity analyses indicated increased connectivity between the hypothalamus and a cluster in the limbic lobe for individuals with the rs53576A genotype during viewing of unpleasant social pictures.

"B5KAM9PQ","thesis","2017","Chen, Xin","Understanding student behaviors using immediate feedback features in a blended learning environment","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1878905118?accountid=14026","Feedback serves to close the gap between learners' current understanding and the desired understanding. Informative feedback can keep students from holding onto misconceptions, actively engage learners in knowledge acquisition, and increase confidence and motivation to learn. Yet, in the context of higher education, it is usually not possible for instructors to provide timely feedback to every individual student. This is especially difficult in first-year foundational courses due to the large number of students. Online learning platforms offer a solution by providing students immediate feedback during the course of their interactions with formative assessment tools (e.g., online homework, quizzes, embedded questions in lecture videos). However, how students choose to interact with these features and how these features influence students' learning experiences have not been well understood. Even less is known about student behaviors with these immediate feedback features in a blended learning class. Fortunately, there is now a mechanism to address these questions since the ever-increasing usage of online learning platforms such as edX (www.edx.org), Coursera (www.coursera.org), and FutureLearn (www.futurelearn.com) enables the detailed recordings of student activities (e.g., usage logs, message streams, mobile device data). These large-scale data allow researchers to understand student behaviors in ways that were not possible before. This study addresses the need to understand student behaviors using immediate feedback features in a blended learning environment utilizing rich server tracking log data. A mix of inductive and deductive statistical and data mining techniques including correlation analysis, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, K-means clustering, and multiple linear regression with LASSO variable reduction are used to recognize the students' common behavioral patterns and understand their correlations, if any, with the students' course performance. The results were supplemented with survey results and semi-structured interview data. The implications are two-fold: (1) increased understanding of student behaviors with immediate feedback can provide instructors an anchor to give timely interventions and recommendations for students' study strategies, and (2) although the subject studied here is physics, it is a required course for all first-year students who are likely to be majoring in a number of STEM fields afterwards, so the results could inform the pedagogical design of other first-year STEM classes that utilize a blended learning format.

One of the currently accepted hypotheses is that animals can track the odor source by estimating odor concentration using tonically active neurons. However, in turbulent environments, odor concentration is poor guidance since the instantaneous concentration gradient is not steady. Based on animal behavior studies, intermittency, defined as the time interval between odor encounters inherent in the turbulent odor plume structure, was suggested as a potential directional cue for localizing the odor source. Recent work has shown that the spiny lobster, which relies on olfactory search, has specialized populations of bursting olfactory receptor neurons (bORNs) within its olfactory organ which are capable of peripherally encoding intermittency. Therefore, our hypothesis is that a population of bORNs plays a role in olfactory search. In this work, we first enhance the existing bORN model for intermittency coding to incorporate the effect of stimulus amplitude. Then, by studying the odor plume dynamics using real odor plume videos, we show that recurrence theory can be applied in our studies. Specifically, the recurrence time index (T index) of the odor signal dynamics yields a discriminative directional cue which can be estimated online by animals using the developed neural model mechanism. Using a synthetic environment extracted from odor plume videos, we demonstrate and quantify a gradient search strategy for olfactory search based on bilateral sensing of intermittency as well as instantaneous concentration. Results show that search based on intermittency is more efficient than search based on instantaneous concentration. As the neural model is based on a large population of neurons, we use calcium imaging, which is a very efficient data recording technique. Unfortunately, its temporal resolution is low and the relation between spike and calcium signal is unknown, so we propose a methodology to automatically extract spike burst timings based on maximum entropy blind deconvolution. This can facilitate data collection with a minimal decrease in time precision versus single cell recordings.

"MJKGDVJE","thesis","2017","Xu, Tan","Microblogging temporal summarization: Filtering important Twitter updates for breaking news","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1883359200?accountid=14026","While news stories are an important traditional medium to broadcast and consume news, microblogging has recently emerged as a place where people can discuss, disseminate, collect or report information about news. However, the massive information in the microblogosphere makes it hard for readers to keep up with these real-time updates. This is especially a problem when it comes to breaking news, where people are more eager to know ""what is happening"". Therefore, this dis- sertation is intended as an exploratory effort to investigate computational methods to augment human effort when monitoring the development of breaking news on a given topic from a microblog stream by extractively summarizing the updates in a timely manner. More specifically, given an interest in a topic, either entered as a query or presented as an initial news report, a microblog temporal summarization system is proposed to filter microblog posts from a stream with three primary concerns: topical relevance, novelty, and salience. Considering the relatively high arrival rate of microblog streams, a cascade framework consisting of three stages is proposed to progressively reduce quantity of posts. For each step in the cascade, this dissertation studies methods that improve over current baselines. In the relevance filtering stage, query and document expansion techniques are applied to mitigate sparsity and vocabulary mismatch issues. The use of word embedding as a basis for filtering is also explored, using unsupervised and supervised modeling to characterize lexical and semantic similarity. In the novelty filtering stage, several statistical ways of characterizing novelty are investigated and ensemble learning techniques are used to integrate results from these diverse techniques. These results are compared with a baseline clustering approach using both standard and delay-discounted measures. In the salience filtering stage, because of the real-time prediction requirement a method of learning verb phrase usage from past relevant news reports is used in conjunction with some standard measures for characterizing writing quality. Following a Cranfield-like evaluation paradigm, this dissertation includes a se- ries of experiments to evaluate the proposed methods for each step, and for the end- to-end system. New microblog novelty and salience judgments are created, building on existing relevance judgments from the TREC Microblog track. The results point to future research directions at the intersection of social media, computational journalism, information retrieval, automatic summarization, and machine learning.

The vast majority of published findings on the GBG have supported its effectiveness in decreasing disruptive behavior in classroom settings. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and the social validity of a positive variation of the GBG in which teachers were asked to use ClassDojo to manage each team's progress. ClassDojo is a computer-based program that enables teachers to track student behavior and monitor progress by way of a virtual system. Dependent variables included class-wide disruptive and academically engaged behavior (AEB), teachers' ratings on the Behavior Intervention Rating Scale (BIRS), and the rate of teacher praise statements delivered in each phase. Overall, results indicated that a positive variation of the GBG with ClassDojo was effective at reducing disruptive behavior, increasing AEB, and was rated as socially valid. Additionally, when the GBG was in place, increases in the amount of behavior-specific praise (BSP) statements delivered were observed across all three classrooms.

During the period 2004–2014 there were large reductions in the population of young people detained in custody in England and Wales. The number of young people requiring hospital transfer fell during this period but to a much lesser degree. The possible reasons for this are discussed and include the increased complexity of young people in custody and the increased availability of secure psychiatric beds.

This wide-spread adoption of LMS technology has fundamentally changed the learning environment for today's campus-based college student, yet there is a lack of research that investigates how students engage with the learning environments created by the prevalent use of these systems. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between campus-based students' perceived level of engagement in LMS an online learning environment and their online behaviour as measured by log data for various LMS activities. Additionally, this study examined faculty members' use of an LMS and the impact of that use on students' engagement and students' use of the LMS. The results of the analysis reveal no correlation between students' online engagement as measured by the Student Engagement Questionnaire (SEQ) and frequency counts of LMS activities. Small correlations were found between students' estimates of their LMS activity in discussion forums and their overall SEQ score. There was no difference in the mean SEQ score between groups of survey respondents based on faculty use of the LMS, but some differences in student estimates of their activity in discussion forums were found between student respondents grouped by age and gender.

Behavioral intervention, which includes the observation of a problematic behavior and a resultant plan on how to address or prevent that behavior, has been demonstrated to substantially increase the quality of life for these individuals. Most forms of behavioral intervention, due to its empirical underpinnings, require interventionists to track the occurrence of the problematic behavior in order to evaluate the efficacy of the implemented plan. Most often, this involves the use of paper tracking sheets. Little attention has been paid to the way that behaviors have been tracked during the process of behavioral intervention. Paper tracking does not offer accountability and, in real world settings, is often neglected by staff members who work with individuals with severe developmental disabilities. The result is poor data which reduces the efficacy of behavioral intervention plans. This study involved the creation of a smart phone application which was used to track the occurrence of consultant identified problematic behaviors in adults with developmental disabilities. The application was evaluated in a day program for adults with developmental disabilities. Staff at the program were trained to use the application. In a single subject design, paper and electronic behavior tracking were compared. The results suggest that electronic charting was able to capture more instances of problematic behavior than was captured on paper. However, it is unclear how accurate the charting via paper or electronic means is in this setting. An exploratory survey was administered to assess staff's attitudes towards behavioral interventions and the individuals with whom they work. Data on their personality characteristics and racial identification was also collected. The survey may have implications for staff hiring. Subsequent studies may further refine the survey questions.

For those patients who experience frequent seizures and whose lives are greatly impacted, resective surgery removing epileptogenic foci is the last viable treatment option. The aim of this research is to develop and evaluate the EEG based noninvasive neuroimaging approaches to study the epileptogenic foci of epilepsy patients. Toward this goal, we have i) studied the feasibility of performing source connectivity based spatio-temporal dipole method for localizing ictal sources; ii) obtained the high-density scalp EEG recording in epilepsy patient and studied the effect of electrode numbers on source localization accuracy; iii) utilized the dynamic seizure imaging approach to track seizure activities in pediatric epilepsy patients; iv) established the high-frequency source imaging approach to image the scalp recorded pathological high-frequency activity in epilepsy patients; v) developed a method to estimate the source extent from noninvasive scalp recording. The methods were rigorously tested in a series of computer simulations and in different groups of epilepsy patients. Patient-specific structural MRI based head model was used to achieve high-accuracy volume conduction modeling of the brain source. Clinical diagnoses such as seizure onset zone of intracranial recording, surgical resection, and surgical outcome were used to evaluate the imaging approaches. The present study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing high-density EEG recordings and high-resolution source imaging in localizing epileptic activity and indicates its potential application in pre-surgical planning of epilepsy patients.

With the growth of online and blended learning environments, the amount of data that researchers and practitioners collect from learning experiences has also grown. The field of learning analytics is concerned with using this data to improve teaching and learning. Many learning analytics systems focus on instructors or administrators, but these tools fail to involve students in the data-driven decision-making process. Providing feedback to students and involving students in this decision-making process can increase intrinsic motivation and help students succeed in online and blended environments. To support online and blended teaching and learning, the focus of this document is student-facing learning analytics dashboards.

Methods: A mixed-method research design was used to examine impacts of 52 systematic reviews published by the SWCG. We conducted author surveys and retrieved multiple sources of bibliometric data. Results: Campbell SWCG reviews were downloaded 136,356 times and cited 3,184 times. Most reviews did not receive significant attention in alternative outlets (i.e., social media). Review authors provided evidence that reviews were used directly to make changes in policy or practice or inform future research. Discussion: Assessing the use and impacts of research is challenging. While downloads and citations provide evidence that these reviews receive attention, it was more difficult to determine the extent to which the reviews were used to impact practice or policy. More work is needed to better track and assess impacts of Campbell reviews.

"UK6CXPEN","thesis","2018","Murmuria, Rahul","Modeling user behavior on smartphones","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2111132041?accountid=14026","Nowadays, we routinely use our smartphones as a gateway to vital information. Person- ally Identifiable Information and other information including financial transactions, medical records, social connections, and daily activities are currently stored in our mobile devices. While smartphones are shipped with biometric sensors such as fingerprint, retina, and heart- beat scanners, which can act as an access control mechanism to the device, their application poses new security risks and it does not provide continuous authentication. Any adversary who is able to breach the initial authentication screen can gain full access to sensitive data and device functionality through application and can cause significant harm to the device owner. Assessing the users identity continuously during active use of applications and data access can raise the bar in terms of how we authenticate to mobile devices. This dissertation focuses on the continuous behavioral modeling of users for active authentication leveraging novel machine learning techniques. To that end, we leverage measurements from touchscreen and movement sensors already present in mobile smartphones to detect behavior deviations from the expected user profiles. We show when such deviations are a product of an actual imposter attack or a drift in the user behavioral profile caused by temporary or permanent changes in physical or mental condition of the user, for instance, a progressing knee condition, or temporary intoxication. To achieve that, we introduce a trust score scale which tracks the user behavior and provides a score between 0 100 enabling us to track and absorb any localized false positives and reduce the false negatives because access is not binary. Thus, in contrast with related research, our method does not need an explicit decision boundary between the genuine user and the imposter. Users are expected to occasionally deviate from their habits and lose access to some protected data intermittently, but regain access without explicitly being locked out. To establish on-device data security, the user can implement a security policy where access can be granted to specific applications and files according to the level of sensitivity and the ongoing trust score. The produced trust score can be shared with 3rd party applications that need to detect when users are behaving uncharacteristically. These applications include banking and health care, where other competing solutions involve exporting sensitive data to multiple remote entities. The performance of the proposed behavioral modeling techniques has been verified on data collected from over 250 users across 3 datasets collected under different conditions. The evaluation using our real-world, unrestricted mobile use data shows that our models are unbiased and generalize to real-world applications. This dissertation is also the first to propose a solution to mitigate population statistics-driven attacks where behavior common to most users is used as the attack vector. The findings of this research suggest that our methods are stronger than other proposed solutions in any practical scenario and can be used in commercial off-the-self mobile devices.

Methods: The Clinician Apps Survey was developed and contained 3 question domains (smartphone apps use, behavior theory in counseling sessions, and demographics) to explore frequency, types, preferred features, benefits/barriers of using apps, counseling techniques used, and clinician demographics. Clinicians (n = 719) were recruited to complete the online survey through 4 dietetics and diabetes professional groups. Clinician use and preferences for health-related apps for personal reasons and in patient care settings were determined, and comparisons were made between high and non-app users. Descriptive statistics were used with current practices and attitudes about apps. Chi-square test of independence compared those using apps both personally and professionally (app enthusiasts) vs those with no app use. Results: There were more app enthusiasts (53%; n = 380) than non-app users (20%; n = 145). Whereas 68% recommended pen/paper methods for diet and physical activity monitoring, 62% recommended apps. Most agreed that apps were superior to traditional methods for patients to track dietary intake (62%) and physical activity (58%), make better food choices (34%), lose weight (45%), and track blood glucose (43%). App enthusiasts used the American Association of Diabetes Educators self-care guidelines ( P = .001) and advanced counseling techniques (eg, motivational interviewing) more often than did non-app users ( P < .004). Apps most frequently recommended to clients were MyFitnessPal (n = 425), CalorieKing (n = 356), and Fitbit (n = 312). Conclusions and Implications: Health-related smartphone apps are being widely used and recommended to patients with diabetes and obesity by clinicians for self-monitoring of dietary and physical activity behaviors. Furthermore, many clinicians believe that these types of tracking apps may improve patient outcomes compared with traditional methods of monitoring dietary and physical activity behaviors.

"CA9UH7BI","thesis","2018","Dietrich, Amelia J.","The role of probabilistic cues in L2 processing: Verb bias in Spanish and English","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2120611574?accountid=14026","The majority of sentence processing research has focused on monolingual populations, but in today's global society bilinguals are ubiquitous. In light of this, it is important to investigate sentence processing in bilinguals, and especially what factors might lead to high proficiency in a bilingual's second language. One measure of this is how a bilingual achieves fully native-like performance in a bilingual's second language. Verb subcategorization bias is one probabilistic cue shown to be used in monolingual sentence processing. Previous research with Spanish-English bilinguals has pointed towards the importance of immersion in the L2 for developing target performance with experience-based cues such as verb bias, but in populations immersed in their L1, transfer of L1 verb bias information has not been observed, even when highly activated cognate verbs are present in the stimuli. This raises the question: Is it the case that probabilistic cues like verb bias are not subject to L1 transfer during L2 processing, in contrast with what has been observed for lexical and grammatical properties? Or is there information missing from the assumptions about verb bias in the two languages in previous studies? To answer these questions, the studies in this dissertation had two principal goals: 1) To conduct a corpus study of complement-taking verbs in Spanish and English to determine the subcategorization biases of those verbs, as well as the linguistic contexts which co-occur with them; and 2) To use the information derived from the corpus study to inform and provide materials for an eye-tracking study which investigates how bilinguals use L1 and L2 verb bias information during online sentence parsing. Given that verb bias is one of many experience-based sources of information found to be useful during processing, bilingual groups immersed in their L1 and their L2 were included to examine how L2 immersion modulates the use of L1 and L2 information during processing in the L2. This dissertation is significant for a number of reasons. First, to my knowledge, this is the first large-scale corpus study investigating verb bias in Spanish. Through its design, this dissertation contributes a body of verb bias information in Spanish comparable to the existing information in English, thus paving the way for additional future verb bias research in other contexts when one of the languages studied is Spanish. In addition, this dissertation further strengthens and expands what is known about verb bias in English and cross-linguistically by developing among the first known multivariate models of verb bias in English and Spanish. The comparison of verb bias across corpora and cross-linguistically finds that while verb bias can differ from one language to another, the level of concordance across languages is actually quite high, and the level of concordance across corpora even higher, supporting a view that the structural features of verb bias are, to some extent, semantically driven. This dissertation is also among the first efforts to employ naturally occurring sentences selected from a corpus as stimuli in a lab-based processing study, thereby helping to close the perceived gap between laboratory results and what speakers do when processing naturally-occurring language. Twice, eye-tracking data from monolingual English speakers in this dissertation, using both laboratory-created and corpus-extract stimuli, replicated processing patterns found in previous experimental studies of verb bias and demonstrated that native speakers are sensitive to frequency-based cues to structure during online processing. Moreover, evidence from bilingual groups finds that with enough proficiency and immersion experience, second language learners are able to make use of those same cues in their target language.

Improvements in sanitation and medicine shifted the focus in these fields from disease prevention to health promotion. In this line of research, a new survey instrument was constructed to assess the extent to which individuals conceptualize maintaining their own health as a function of disease prevention and health promotion. The instrument was initially tested on an online sample (N = 1243). A structural equation model was specified in this study to test whether scores on this instrument predicted self-reported health behaviors and outcomes. In a second study (N = 405), the results replicated the initial structural equation model and additional models were tested with a larger set of health-related behaviors. Lastly, the survey was tested in controlled laboratory settings, in which objective health behaviors were examined under experimental manipulation (Ns = 101 and 38). The results of these studies suggest that individuals do conceptualize staying healthy as a function of health promotion and disease prevention as two separate, but positively correlated constructs. Further, individuals' endorsements of disease prevention and health promotion predicted self-reported health behaviors, BMI, and subjective health ratings. Future research will be needed to examine more objectively measured health behaviors, as the current findings are based primarily on self-report and subjective measures of health.

The aim of this study was to further explore these relations using a comprehensive battery of hearing and listening, cognitive, and psychosocial measures. Fifty-one, community-dwelling older adults (65+ years) with a range of hearing ability completed a battery of tests. Hearing and listening abilities were assessed using pure-tone audiometry, three measures of speech perception, and self-report questionnaires. Cognitive tests included measures of memory, working memory, executive functioning, language, and processing speed. Self-report measures included hearing-specific disability measures as well as general measures of loneliness, depression, and social network. An ambulatory recording device, the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR), was used to objectively measure aspects of quality and quantity of social interaction. Results demonstrated that measures of speech perception were significantly and positively associated with cognitive measures in multiple domains, including executive function, memory, and processing speed, with speech perception in noise showing the most robust associations after controlling for age. Poorer speech perception was significantly associated with a greater amount of communication breakdowns, an EAR-derived measure of quality of social interaction, and marginally significantly associated with more objectively-measured time spent alone. Poorer speech perception was also more robustly associated with hearing-specific disability measures than general measures of psychosocial health. The present study found that greater hearing loss was associated with poorer performance on various measures of cognition as well as lower psychosocial functioning, as measured by the EAR and self-report. The consequences of hearing loss extend beyond difficulties in communication and warrant further scientific investigation as our population ages.

Numerous studies show the effectiveness of this method both in a clinical context and in the laboratory. However, research results on the effectiveness of VR in pediatric venipuncture pain is not conclusive—not all studies report the analgesic effect of VR. In addition to testing effectiveness of VR, we also assess the usability of a novel hands‐free interface. Design and Methods: Patients of paediatric nephrology clinic ( N = 38; mean age 11 years, range 7–17) participated in a posttest only between group quasi‐experimental study. Participants in the treatment group received the venipuncture procedure with VR distraction. They were wearing a head‐mounted Oculus DK2 HMD, and playing a game designed by the authors of the study. The game was based on Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) task, where players have to remember and simultaneously track several moving targets. MOT has been used in many studies on attention and working memory. Participants rated their pain and stress intensity on visual analogue scales (VAS) on a scale of 0 to 100 and answered a short questionnaire. Results: The VR group reported significantly lower pain intensity than the controls (mean = 15.16 ± 20.51 vs. 37.05 ± 30.66; t = 2.59, df = 36, p < .02, d = 0.863). Similar results were obtained for stress level (11.16 ±18.58 vs 41.89 ± 40.89; t = 2.98, df = 36, p < .01, d = 0.993). There were no correlations with age. Practice Implications: VR can be as an effective tool to minimize pediatric pain and stress due to venipuncture. The MOT‐based VR game was suitable for children at the studied age range. This solution can be easily applied by nurses in their clinical practice.

"G2GM5Y6Y","thesis","2018","Schultz, Nicole","School employee wellness: Understanding health behaviors and identifying opportunities for student and staff health promotion","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2126640073?accountid=14026","BACKGROUND: Despite the growth of workplace wellness nationwide, schools lag behind other employers in the promotion of employee health and the provision of employee wellness programming. School employees, however, serve as role models for students, and are called upon to deliver student health-related programs, including physical activity (PA) programs. Employee wellness can increase productivity, boost morale, save money, and, in the school setting, potentially enhance student program implementation and academic success. However, evidence suggests poor health among school employees. The primary objectives of this research were to provide evidence to support the need for and value of school employee wellness, particularly in underserved school districts, and to inform employee wellness efforts in the school setting. METHODS: Employees were recruited from lower-income Massachusetts schools participating in the Fueling Learning Through Exercise (FLEX) Study, a group randomized-controlled trial evaluating two school-based PA programs. Focus groups were conducted to identify barriers and facilitators to healthy behaviors. Employees participated in Wellness Assessments, including measured height, weight, and lipids [total (TC), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C)]. Surveys were used to collect demographic, perceived stress, PA and 24-hour food intake data. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship among health behaviors (PA and diet), stress and cardiometabolic health. An interaction between stress and health behaviors was explored. Lastly, intervention implementation, PA environment (PAE) scores, student demographics and objectively measured student school-time moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were collected from FLEX. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between employee MVPA and (1) intervention implementation, accounting for stress, and (2) student school-time MVPA. The impact of the PAE on the relationship between employee MVPA and intervention implementation was explored. RESULTS: Findings from the focus groups (10 sessions, N=62) highlighted the importance of an organizational culture of wellness. Barriers included High Stress, Demanding Job, Lack of Wellness Culture, and Unhealthy Food. Facilitators included a Desire to Adopt Healthy Behaviors and Role Model, Sufficient Health Knowledge, and a Strong Social Network. Seventy-four employees (66% teachers) participated in Wellness Assessments. Overweight/obesity, high TC and LDL-C were observed in 47% (mean BMI: 25.6 kg/m2), 4%, and 34%, respectively, and MVPA was low (median: 17 min/day). Significant positive associations were identified between MVPA and cardiometabolic health. The relationship between MVPA and BMI was modified by stress (p-for-interaction=0.001), with higher levels of stress associated with a diminished protective association between MVPA and BMI. Higher stress was also associated with lower implementation (p<0.0001). Contrary to our hypothesis, higher employee MVPA was associated with lower student school-time MVPA (p=0.0002) and lower implementation (p<0.0001), with a stronger negative relationship in schools with higher PAE scores (p-for-interaction <0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate physical inactivity and high stress among school employees, and suggest that this population would be receptive to wellness programming if barriers were minimized. Promising approaches to employee health promotion include wellness champions, accountability, and convenience. Observed relationships between employee PA and both implementation and student PA, which were contrary to our hypotheses, warrant further investigation as our analysis was limited by school-level employee PA data.

MOOCs provide an opportunity to teach interesting or critical content to new groups of learners who may not otherwise have the chance to receive high-quality education. As such, MOOCs have inspired rethinking and innovation in university education. Tens of thousands of enrolled students create a disruptive scale factor that raises both new possibilities and challenges, while inviting new visions and agendas. Although MOOCs have been broadly recognized and are considered to be an innovation in online education, researchers and practitioners have little understanding of (1) what the best practices are for students, instructors, or even MOOC carriers because of the newness of the MOOC paradigm, (2) how to improve student retention given the high dropout rate and (3) how to better support MOOC instructors to help them produce more attractive MOOCs. To better understand and address these issues, I apply mixed methods -- interviews and various sorts of log data analysis -- to characterize distinctive students' and instructors' motivations, perceptions, challenges and activity patterns during learning/teaching in MOOCs. Based on this richer understanding, I use scenario based design method to identify and present instructional and platform design implications for the next generation of MOOCs.

Here, bringing together concepts from social network theory, animal personality, and parasite manipulation of host behaviour, I argue that not only are social networks shaping parasite transmission, but parasites in turn shape social networks through their effects on the behaviour of infected individuals. Firstly, I review five general categories of behaviour (mating behaviour, aggressiveness, activity levels, spatial distribution, and group formation) that are closely tied to social networks, and provide evidence that parasites can affect all of them. Secondly, I describe scenarios in which behaviour-altering parasites can modify either the role or position of individual hosts within their social network, or various structural properties (e.g., connectance, modularity) of the entire network. Experimental approaches allowing comparisons of social networks pre- versus post-infection are a promising avenue to explore the feedback loop between social networks and parasite infections.

An unobtrusive smartphone application called “Instant Quantified Self” monitored daily smartphone unlocks and daily minutes of use. Other mediators included self-reported smartphone use, self-observed studying attention, self-reported multitasking preference, and a classroom digital metacognition tool that assessed the student’s ability to understand the ramifications of technology use in the classroom that is not relevant to the learning process. Two hundred sixteen participants collected an average of 56 days of “Instant” application data, demonstrating that their smartphone was unlocked more than 60 times a day for three to four minutes each time for a total of 220 daily minutes of use. Results indicated that executive functioning problems predicted academic course performance mediated by studying attention and a single classroom digital metacognition subscale concerning availability of strategies of when to use mobile phones during lectures. FOMO predicted performance directly as well as mediated by a second classroom digital metacognition concerning attitudes toward mobile phone use during lectures. Implications for college students and professors include increasing metacognition about technology use in the classroom and taking “tech breaks” to reduce technology anxiety.

Se propuso un modelo que postulaba que el desempeño académico podía predecirse mediante una variable independiente cognitiva (los problemas de funcionamiento ejecutivo) y una variable independiente afectiva (la ansiedad tecnológica o FOMO –el miedo a perderse algo), influido por el modo como los alumnos elegían utilizar la tecnología. Mediante una aplicación para móvil no intrusiva, denominada “Yo cuantificado instantáneo” seguía los desbloqueos diarios del móvil y los minutos de uso. Había otros mediadores, como el uso del móvil según el usuario, la atención en el estudio según la observa el usuario, preferencias de multi-tarea según el usuario y una nueva herramienta de medida digital en el aula para analizar la capacidad del alumno para entender las ramificaciones del uso de la tecnología en el aula que no es relevante para el proceso de aprendizaje. Un total de 216 participantes recogieron datos de la aplicación “instantánea” durante una media de 56 días, mostrando que su teléfono móvil era desbloqueado más de 60 veces al día entre tres y cuatro minutos cada vez durante un total de 220 minutos diarios de uso. Los resultados indicaban que los problemas de funcionamiento ejecutivo predecían el rendimiento académico mediatizado por la atención en el estudio y una única subescala de metacognición digital en el aula relativa a la disponibilidad de estrategias sobre cuándo utilizar el móvil durante las clases. El FOMO predecía el desempeño directamente además de a través de una segunda metacognición digital del aula relativa a las actitudes hacia el teléfono móvil durante las clases. Entre las implicaciones para los alumnos y los profesores está el aumento de la metacognición sobre el uso de la tecnología en el aula y “descansar de la tecnología” para disminuir la ansiedad que produce.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate an adaptive step goal + reward intervention, grounded in Social Cognitive Theory delivered via a smartphone application (Just Walk), using a mixed modeling approach. Participants (N = 20) were overweight (mean BMI = 33.8 ± 6.82 kg/m²), sedentary adults (90% female) interested in participating in a 14-week walking intervention. All participants received a Fitbit Zip that automatically synced with Just Walk to track daily steps. Step goals and expected points were delivered through the app every morning and were designed using a pseudo-random multisine algorithm that was a function of each participant’s median baseline steps. Self-report measures were also collected each morning and evening via daily surveys administered through the app. The linear mixed effects model showed that, on average, participants significantly increased their daily steps by 2650 (t = 8.25,  p < 0.01) from baseline to intervention completion. A non-linear model with a quadratic time variable indicated an inflection point for increasing steps near the midpoint of the intervention and this effect was significant (t² = −247, t = −5.01, p < 0.001). An adaptive step goal + rewards intervention using a smartphone app appears to be a feasible approach for increasing walking behavior in overweight adults. App satisfaction was high and participants enjoyed receiving variable goals each day. Future mHealth studies should consider the use of adaptive step goals + rewards in conjunction with other intervention components for increasing physical activity.

Differently from previous studies that rely on self-reporting mobile phone usage data, which tends to significantly underestimate the time spent by students at their phones, we employed Apps (namely ‘Moment’ and ‘App Usage Tracker’) to effectively measure actual usage. Collecting data from 43 students at Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV), a business school from São Paulo, Brazil, our analysis yielded a significant negative relationship between total time spent using smartphones and academic performance, after controlling for known predictors of performance such as self-efficacy and past academic results. Each 100 min spent using the device on average per day corresponded to a reduction in a student's position at the school's ranking of 6.3 points, in a range from 0 to nearly 100. Moreover, if we consider usage during class time only (as opposed to during free time and weekends), the effect was almost twice as high. The magnitude of the effect found is alarming. Thus, this study brings new evidence of the potential harm of excessive smartphone use and should be useful for educators and other academic stakeholders interested in the subject of the impact of technology on students' performance.

The mechanisms underlying any effects of such apps are also unclear. This study examined the effectiveness of a self-monitoring mobile phone app by investigating the relationships between app engagement and mental health outcomes. Method: Participants downloaded the MoodPrism app from the iOS and Android app stores, completing in-app assessments at start of use and again 30 days later. The app prompted participants daily to complete a short mood questionnaire and formulated their responses into a mood diary. Data from 234 assessment completers (73% female; M age = 34.8 years) were analysed via hierarchical and mediation regressions. Results: In this community sample, app engagement ratings predicted decreases in depression and anxiety, and increases in mental well-being. These effects were mediated by increases in emotional self-awareness, but only for participants who were clinically depressed or anxious at the time of the baseline assessment. Mental health literacy and coping self-efficacy did not play mediating roles. Limitations: Findings suggest that other influential mediators may have not been measured, and future studies could verify the findings by using alternative methodologies, such as comparison with a control group. Conclusions: Engaging with an emotional wellbeing self-monitoring app may reduce depressive and anxious symptoms, and increase mental well-being. Increases in emotional self-awareness may mediate these changes in clinical populations, and further research is needed to reveal other mechanisms that mental health apps can utilize.

Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between multiple SEP indicators (maternal education, family income, SEP composite, cumulative family income) at birth, 11, 15 and 18 years, and five sedentary behavior outcomes (≥ 4h/day screen time; ≥ 4h/day TV; ≥ 2h/day computer; ≥ 2h/day video game; ≥ 12.7 h/day objectively measured sedentary time) at 11, 15 and 18 years, were examined. In cross-sectional analyses, higher SEP was positively associated with more screen time at ages 11 and 15 years. There was a consistent and positive association between higher SEP with time spent using a computer, and with sedentary time assessed through accelerometry. SEP at birth had a positive and direct effect on screen, computer and total sedentary time at 18 years. Participants in the highest cumulative income group had higher odds of high sedentary behavior in screen (OR: 2.40; 95% CI: 1.50–3.54), computer (OR: 7.35; 95% CI: 4.19–12.89) and total sedentary time (OR: 5.40; 95% CI: 3.53–10.35), respectively, compared with their counterparts with lower cumulative income.

Survey respondents included school administrators, physical education (PE) teachers, and grade-level chairs. Measures: Physical activity environment factors were assessed via an online questionnaire adapted from school PA surveys and articles. Analysis: The chi-square and Fisher exact analyses were conducted to examine the reporting of PA environment factors overall and by school SES, as measured by free/reduced lunch rate, and/or racial/ethnic composition. Results: Overall, many PA environment factors were widely prevalent (ie, gym [99%] or field [79%] access), although some factors such as some PA-related programs (ie, a structured walk/bike program [11%]) were less widely reported. Disparities in school PA environment factors were largely patterned by SES, though they varied for some factors by racial/ethnic composition and across SES within racial/ethnic composition categories. For example, lower SES schools were less likely to report access to blacktops and tracks ( p-value < .0001), and higher SES schools were less likely to report access to playgrounds ( p-value = .0076). Lower SES schools were also less likely to report “always/often” giving access to PE/PA equipment during recess ( p-value < .01). Lower SES and majority nonwhite schools were less likely to report having joint use agreements with community agencies ( p-value < .0001). Conclusion: This study highlights SES and racial/ethnic disparities in PA environments in Georgia public elementary schools.

In these networks, two news outlets are connected if they share a fraction of their audiences. We propose two crucial improvements to the methodology employed in previous research: a statistical test to filter out non-significant overlap between sites; and a thresholding approach to identify the core of the audience network. We explain why our approach is better than previous approaches using two data sets: one tracks digital news consumption during the 2016 Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom and the other during the 2016 Presidential Election in the United States.

With increases in technology use among older adults, mobile applications may provide a solution for older adults to self-manage symptoms of HF. This article discusses the development and acceptability of a HF symptom-tracking mobile application (HF app). Methodology: The HF app was developed to allow patients to track their symptoms of HF. Thirty ( N = 30) older adults completed an acceptability survey after using the mobile app. The survey used Likert items and open-ended feedback questions. Results: Overall, the acceptability feedback from users was positive with participants indicating that the HF app was both easy to use and understand. Participants identified recommendations for improvement including additional symptoms to track and the inclusion of instructions and reminders. Conclusion: HF is common in older adults, and acceptability of mobile apps is of key importance. The HF app is an acceptable tool for older patients with HF to self-manage their symptoms, identify patterns, and changes in symptoms, and ultimately prevent HF readmission.

Given the time-limited classroom environment, seeking methods to impart this foundational knowledge to students in an efficient manner is essential. Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) methods incorporate pre-class exercises (typically online) meant to establish foundational knowledge in novice learners so subsequent instructor-led sessions can focus on deeper, more complex concepts. Determining how best do we design and assess pre-class exercises requires a detailed examination of learning and retention in an applied educational context. Here we used electroencephalography (EEG) as a quantitative dependent variable to track learning and examine the efficacy of JiTT activities to teach anatomy. Specifically, we examined changes in the amplitude of the N250 and reward positivity event-related brain potential (ERP) components alongside behavioral performance as novice students participated in a series of computerized reinforcement-based learning modules to teach neuroanatomical structures. We found that as students learned to identify anatomical structures, the amplitude of the N250 increased and reward positivity amplitude decreased in response to positive feedback. Both on a retention and transfer exercise when learners successfully remembered and translated their knowledge to novel images, the amplitude of the reward positivity remained decreased compared to early learning. Our findings suggest ERPs can be used as a tool to track learning, retention, and transfer of knowledge and that employing the reinforcement learning paradigm is an effective educational approach for developing anatomical expertise.

The use of social networking sites such as Facebook for the delivery of health behavior programs is relatively new. Objective: The primary aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a Web-based beginners’ running program for adults aged 18 to 50 years, delivered via a Facebook group, in increasing physical activity (PA) and cardiorespiratory fitness. Methods: A total of 89 adults with a mean age of 35.2 years (SD 10.9) were recruited online and via print media. Participants were randomly allocated to receive the UniSA Run Free program, an 8-week Web-based beginners’ running intervention, delivered via a closed Facebook group (n = 41) that included daily interactive posts (information with links, motivational quotes, opinion polls, or questions) and details of the running sessions; or to the control group who received a hard copy of the running program (n = 48). Assessments were completed online at baseline, 2 months, and 5 months. The primary outcome measures were self-reported weekly moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and objectively measured cardiorespiratory fitness. Secondary outcomes were social support, exercise attitudes, and self-efficacy. Analyses were undertaken using random effects mixed modeling. Compliance with the running program and engagement with the Facebook group were analyzed descriptively. Results: Both groups significantly increased MVPA across the study period ( P = .004); however, this was significantly higher in the Facebook group ( P = .04). The Facebook group increased their MVPA from baseline by 140 min/week versus 91 min for the control at 2 months. MVPA remained elevated for the Facebook group (from baseline) by 129 min/week versus a 50 min/week decrease for the control at 5 months. Both groups had significant increases in social support scores at 2 months ( P = .02); however, there were no group by time differences ( P = .16). There were no significant changes in the other outcomes. A process evaluation revealed relatively high levels of engagement with the Facebook group during the 8-week intervention (eg, mean number of interactions 35 [SD 41]). Conclusions: An 8-week beginners’ running program delivered through Facebook produced sizable and sustained changes in weekly MVPA and received strong engagement and positive feedback from participants. Future research investigating this intervention approach is warranted in other populations and health behaviors.

New concepts are emerging with the development of more accurate means of collecting live data, computerized questionnaires, and the use of passive data.  Digital phenotyping, a paradigmatic example, refers to the use of computerized measurement tools to capture the characteristics of different psychiatric disorders. Similarly, machine learning–a form of artificial intelligence–can improve the classification of patients based on patterns that clinicians have not always considered in the past. Remote or automated interventions (web-based or smartphone-based apps), as well as virtual reality and neurofeedback, are already available or under development. Objective: These recent changes have the potential to disrupt practices, as well as practitioners’ beliefs, ethics and representations, and may even call into question their professional culture. However, the impact of new technologies on health professionals’ practice in addictive disorder care has yet to be determined. In the present paper, we therefore present an overview of new technology in the field of addiction medicine. Method: Using the keywords [e-health], [m-health], [computer], [mobile], [smartphone], [wearable], [digital], [machine learning], [ecological momentary assessment], [biofeedback] and [virtual reality], we searched the PubMed database for the most representative articles in the field of assessment and interventions in substance use disorders. Results: We screened 595 abstracts and analyzed 92 articles, dividing them into seven categories: e-health program and web-based interventions, machine learning, computerized adaptive testing, wearable devices and digital phenotyping, ecological momentary assessment, biofeedback, and virtual reality. Conclusion: This overview shows that new technologies can improve assessment and interventions in the field of addictive disorders. The precise role of connected devices, artificial intelligence and remote monitoring remains to be defined. If they are to be used effectively, these tools must be explained and adapted to the different profiles of physicians and patients. The involvement of patients, caregivers and other health professionals is essential to their design and assessment.

Aims: This study aimed at extending current research on students' learning strategies by combining general and task‐specific measurements of students' learning strategies using both offline and online measures. We want to clarify how students process learning contents and to what extent this is related to their self‐report of learning strategies. Sample: Twenty students with different generic learning profiles (according to self‐report questionnaires) read an expository text, while their eye movements were registered to answer questions on the content afterwards. Methods: Eye‐tracking data were analysed with generalized linear mixed‐effects models. Results: The results indicate that students with an all‐high profile, combining both deep and surface learning strategies, spend more time on rereading the text than students with an all‐low profile, scoring low on both learning strategies. Conclusions: This study showed that we can use eye‐tracking to distinguish very strategic students, characterized using cognitive processing and regulation strategies, from low strategic students, characterized by a lack of cognitive and regulation strategies.

This study was undertaken to improve a novel type 2 diabetes motivational intervention, (functional imagery training, FIT) based on participant feedback and results from a self-management randomised controlled trial. Design: Qualitative inductive thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews. Main outcome measures: Open-ended questions on participant experiences of the FIT intervention content, process, most/least helpful features, suggestions for improvement and general feedback. Results: Eight themes emerged. Participants thought FIT promoted autonomy and self-awareness. They found the intervention interesting and helpful in keeping their health on track through accountability provided by regular phone calls. However, boredom with repetitive use of imagery, feeling inadequately equipped to manage unhealthy cravings, and difficulty with the time commitment was reported by some. Supplementary written material was recommended. Conclusion: Several well-received features of FIT overlapped with those from traditional motivational interviewing. FIT sessions should ensure content is regularly adapted to new health-enhancing goals. After self-management behaviour becomes habitual, imagery practice could be restricted to challenging contexts. Provision of a written rationale and use of mindfulness for cravings is recommended. With these improvements, the impact of FIT on diabetic control may be substantially enhanced.

Results reveal that, although smartphone use is generally negatively associated with well-being, this is not always so. Deeper analyses show that certain categories of apps are positively associated with well-being, thus revealing a more nuanced relationship between smartphone use and individual well-being. Research which suggests a negative association between smartphone use and well-being may represent an oversimplified perspective of a complex relationship.

Abdelfattah, Samouil L. Farhi, Yongxin Zhao, Daan Brinks, Peng Zou, Araya Ruangkittisakul, Jelena Platisa, Vincent A. Pieribone, Klaus Ballanyi, Adam E. Cohen and Robert E. Campbell ( The Journal of Neuroscience, 2016[Feb][24], Vol 36[8], 2458-2472). In the original article, the units on the y-axes of Figure 3, D and E, were incorrectly labeled as ΔF/F₀. The y-axes should instead be labeled as F/F min. The corrected Figure 3 with its legend is present in the erratum and in the online PDF version of the article. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-14420-007). Optical imaging of voltage indicators based on green fluorescent proteins (FPs) or archaerhodopsin has emerged as a powerful approach for detecting the activity of many individual neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution. Relative to green FP-based voltage indicators, a bright red-shifted FP-based voltage indicator has the intrinsic advantages of lower phototoxicity, lower autofluorescent background, and compatibility with blue-light-excitable channelrhodopsins. Here, we report a bright red fluorescent voltage indicator (fluorescent indicator for voltage imaging red; FlicR1) with properties that are comparable to the best available green indicators. To develop FlicR1, we used directed protein evolution and rational engineering to screen libraries of thousands of variants. FlicR1 faithfully reports single action potentials (∼3% ΔF/F) and tracks electrically driven voltage oscillations at 100 Hz in dissociated Sprague Dawley rat hippocampal neurons in single trial recordings. Furthermore, FlicR1 can be easily imaged with wide-field fluorescence microscopy. We demonstrate that FlicR1 can be used in conjunction with a blue-shifted channelrhodopsin for all-optical electrophysiology, although blue light photoactivation of the FlicR1 chromophore presents a challenge for applications that require spatially overlapping yellow and blue excitation.

The model samples alternatives at the route choice level, which is a lower level of the nesting structure. Alternative routes are drawn using the random walk method. A structured random walk parameter based on trip distance is proposed in order to consider the heterogeneity in trip distance, and a structured scale parameter based on trip distance is also applied for the nested logit model. Dataset is obtained by using mobile phones with GPS functions to track the trajectories in a downtown area at Nagoya, Japan. The results suggest that the proposed structured random walk parameter provides more efficient parameter estimates. Also, heteroscedasticity in the error terms for trips of various distances is found to be significant. Empirical findings include that older pedestrians prefer main shopping streets, and that roadside restaurants affect the route choice differently on weekdays and holidays. The different effects of the roadside environments according to the pedestrian’s attributes and the day of the week may indicate a need for more appropriate policies for specific pedestrian categories and days of the week.

The system provides recommendations for suitable time gaps to enter the intersection based on the observation of crossing traffic. Following an “on-demand”-concept, the driver activates the assistance only if support is desired. In one drive, drivers used the AoD system in every situation they experienced to guarantee that every driver had the same exposure to the system when evaluating it. During another drive, drivers were free to decide if they want to use the system or not. The experimental study compared the AoD system with driving manually and with driving supported by a more conventional visual-based system which was always active at intersections (system showing colored arrows in a simulated head-up display (HUD) to visualize the crossing traffic). This resulted in four drives the drivers had to perform. Every drive consisted of several intersections with varying traffic conditions. The drivers had to turn left at every intersection. A total of 24 drivers took part in the study; one group with 14 middle-aged drivers and another group with ten high-aged drivers. Several questionnaires and online ratings were used to assess drivers’ acceptance, perceived usefulness, benefits and specific characteristics of both system variants. In addition, driving behaviour with regard to gap choice and drivers’ monitoring behaviour (using head tracking data) were analyzed. The results show that the AoD system reaches high acceptance ratings and is preferred compared to the visual, always active system. Using the speech modality for communication and the on-demand concept were both highly appreciated by the drivers. With regard to driving behaviour, the AoD system is comparably safe as manual driving while at the same time making driving easier by facilitating the monitoring of vehicles while waiting at an intersection.

Methods: A total of 1,904 participants were recruited through Sona Systems, Ltd (Tallinn, Estonia), an experiment management system for online research, to complete a self-reported survey. The collected data were used to develop a new measure of mental (behavioral) health stigma. To build a classification predictive model of stigma, a decision tree was used as the data mining tool, wherein a set of classification rules was generated and tested for its ability to examine the prevalence of stigma. Results: A three-factor stigma model was supported and confirmed. Results indicate that the measure is content-valid and internally consistent. Performance evaluation of the machine learning-based classification algorithm revealed a sufficient inter-rater reliability with a predictive accuracy of 92.4 percent. Conclusion: This study illustrates the potential for applying machine learning to derive a data-driven understanding of the extent to which stigma is prevalent in society. It establishes a framework for the development of an index to track stigma over time and to assist healthcare decision-makers with improving the health of populations and the experience of care for patients.

As patients pose questions regarding the validity and use of this technology, curriculum targeting mHealth technology is essential for the future health professionals. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a curriculum expansion which addressed mHealth technology provided to physician assistant (PA) and clinical nutrition (CN) students enrolled in an academic health center. In addition, the validity of the mobile application (app), MyNetDiary, was determined. Methods: A smartphone application appraisal tool, based on scientific recommendations, was developed. Students were taught how to use this tool to evaluate mobile apps. Students received instruction on providing patient education on mobile apps used to track calories and nutrients and mobile medical apps to measure blood pressure. Pre-/ post-surveys and objectively structured clinical examinations measured students' confidence and abilities in teaching patients to use MyNetDiary and Withings Health Mate apps. Wilcoxon rank sum tests evaluated statistical significance. Validity of nutrient estimates was determined using Spearman correlations. Results: Confidence levels improved significantly on all items measured for both PA and CN students ( P < 0.001). During the objectively structured clinical examination, all students demonstrated effective communication skills with 98.4% successfully demonstrating of how to enter foods into the MyNetDiary app and 94.3% connecting the blood pressure cuff with the withings app. Significant correlations were found when comparing MyNetDiary to SuperTracker (all P < 0.001). Discussion: This study investigated and demonstrated the effectiveness of an expanded curriculum designed to enhance students' confidence and skills in providing lifestyle counseling incorporating the use of mHealth technology.

We propose to bridge this gap by i) parametrizing social media usage and academic performance, and ii) combining smartphones and time diaries to keep track of users' activities and their smartphone interaction. We apply our solution on the 72 students participating in the SmartUnitn project, which investigates students' time management and their academic performance. By analyzing the logs of social media apps on students' smartphones and by comparing them to students’ credits and grades, we can provide a quantitative and qualitative estimate of negative and positive correlations.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the diffusion of the digital self-tracking movement in Canada. It provides a comprehensive, yet detailed account of this phenomenon. It examines the profile of digital self-trackers, traditional self-trackers, and nontrackers, further investigating the primary motivations for self-tracking and reasons for nontracking; barriers to adoption of connected care technologies; users’ appreciation of their self-tracking devices, including what they perceive to be the main benefits; factors that influence people’s intention to continue using connected care technologies in the future; and the reasons for usage discontinuance. Methods: We conducted an online survey with a sample of 4109 Canadian adults, one of the largest ever. To ensure a representative sample, quota method was used (gender, age), following stratification by region. The maximum margin of error is estimated at 1.6%, 19 times out of 20. Results: Our findings reveal that 66.20% (2720/4109) of our respondents regularly self-track one or more aspects of their health. About one in 4 respondents (1014/4109, 24.68%) currently owns a wearable or smart medical device, and 57.20% (580/1014) use their devices on a regular basis for self-tracking purposes. Digital self-trackers are typically young or mature adults, healthy, employed, university educated, with an annual family income of over $80,000 CAD. The most popular reported device is the fitness tracker or smartwatch that can capture a range of parameters. Currently, mobile apps and digital self-tracking devices are mainly used to monitor physical activity (856/1669, 51.13%), nutrition (545/1669, 32.65%), sleep patterns (482/1669, 28.88%) and, to a much lesser extent, cardiovascular and pulmonary biomarkers (215/1669, 12.88%), medication intake (126/1669, 7.55%), and glucose level (79/1669, 4.73%). Most users of connected care technologies (481/580, 83.0%) are highly satisfied and 88.2% (511/580) intend to continue using their apps and devices in the future. A majority said smart digital devices have allowed them to maintain or improve their health condition (398/580, 68.5%) and to be better informed about their health in general (387/580, 66.6%). About 33.80% of our sample (1389/4109) is composed of people who do not monitor their health or well-being on a regular basis. Conclusions: Our study shows an opportunity to advance the health of Canadians through connected care technologies. Our findings can be used to set baseline information for future research on the rise of digital health self-tracking and its impacts. Although the use of mobile apps, consumer wearables, and smart medical devices could potentially benefit the growing population of patients with chronic conditions, the question remains as to whether it will diffuse broadly beyond early adopters and across cost inequities.

The methods used to track health spending continue to evolve, but little is known about the distribution of spending across diseases. We developed improved estimates of health spending by source, including development assistance for health, and, for the first time, estimated HIV/AIDS spending on prevention and treatment and by source of funding, for 188 countries. Methods: We collected published data on domestic health spending, from 1995 to 2015, from a diverse set of international agencies. We tracked development assistance for health from 1990 to 2017. We also extracted 5385 datapoints about HIV/AIDS spending, between 2000 and 2015, from online databases, country reports, and proposals submitted to multilateral organisations. We used spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression to generate complete and comparable estimates for health and HIV/AIDS spending. We report most estimates in 2017 purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars and adjust all estimates for the effect of inflation. Findings: Between 1995 and 2015, global health spending per capita grew at an annualised rate of 3·1% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1 to 3·2), with growth being largest in upper-middle-income countries (5·4% per capita [UI 5·3–5·5]) and lower-middle-income countries (4·2% per capita [4·2–4·3]). In 2015, $9·7 trillion (9·7 trillion to 9·8 trillion) was spent on health worldwide. High-income countries spent $6·5 trillion (6·4 trillion to 6·5 trillion) or 66·3% (66·0 to 66·5) of the total in 2015, whereas low-income countries spent $70·3 billion (69·3 billion to 71·3 billion) or 0·7% (0·7 to 0·7). Between 1990 and 2017, development assistance for health increased by 394·7% ($29·9 billion), with an estimated $37·4 billion of development assistance being disbursed for health in 2017, of which $9·1 billion (24·2%) targeted HIV/AIDS. Between 2000 and 2015, $562·6 billion (531·1 billion to 621·9 billion) was spent on HIV/AIDS worldwide. Governments financed 57·6% (52·0 to 60·8) of that total. Global HIV/AIDS spending peaked at 49·7 billion (46·2–54·7) in 2013, decreasing to $48·9 billion (45·2 billion to 54·2 billion) in 2015. That year, low-income and lower-middle-income countries represented 74·6% of all HIV/AIDS disability-adjusted life-years, but just 36·6% (34·4 to 38·7) of total HIV/AIDS spending. In 2015, $9·3 billion (8·5 billion to 10·4 billion) or 19·0% (17·6 to 20·6) of HIV/AIDS financing was spent on prevention, and $27·3 billion (24·5 billion to 31·1 billion) or 55·8% (53·3 to 57·9) was dedicated to care and treatment. Interpretation: From 1995 to 2015, total health spending increased worldwide, with the fastest per capita growth in middle-income countries. While these national disparities are relatively well known, low-income countries spent less per person on health and HIV/AIDS than did high-income and middle-income countries. Furthermore, declines in development assistance for health continue, including for HIV/AIDS. Additional cuts to development assistance could hasten this decline, and risk slowing progress towards global and national goals.

"E6UB3YVQ","journalArticle","2018","Harbison, Amy L.; Woynaroski, Tiffany G.; Tapp, Jon; Wade, Joshua W.; Warlaumont, Anne S.; Yoder, Paul J.","A new measure of child vocal reciprocity in children with autism spectrum disorder","Autism Research","","1939-3792, 1939-3792","10.1002/aur.1942","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2011633016?accountid=14026","Children's vocal development occurs in the context of reciprocal exchanges with a communication partner who models “speechlike” productions. We propose a new measure of child vocal reciprocity, which we define as the degree to which an adult vocal response increases the probability of an immediately following child vocal response. Vocal reciprocity is likely to be associated with the speechlikeness of vocal communication in young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Two studies were conducted to test the utility of the new measure. The first used simulated vocal samples with randomly sequenced child and adult vocalizations to test the accuracy of the proposed index of child vocal reciprocity. The second was an empirical study of 21 children with ASD who were preverbal or in the early stages of language development. Daylong vocal samples collected in the natural environment were computer analyzed to derive the proposed index of child vocal reciprocity, which was highly stable when derived from two daylong vocal samples and was associated with speechlikeness of vocal communication. This association was significant even when controlling for chance probability of child vocalizations to adult vocal responses, probability of adult vocalizations, or probability of child vocalizations. A valid measure of children's vocal reciprocity might eventually improve our ability to predict which children are on track to develop useful speech and/or are most likely to respond to language intervention. A link to a free, publicly‐available software program to derive the new measure of child vocal reciprocity is provided. Lay Summary: Children and adults often engage in back‐and‐forth vocal exchanges. The extent to which they do so is believed to support children's early speech and language development. Two studies tested a new measure of child vocal reciprocity using computer‐generated and real‐life vocal samples of young children with autism collected in natural settings. The results provide initial evidence of accuracy, test‐retest reliability, and validity of the new measure of child vocal reciprocity. A sound measure of children's vocal reciprocity might improve our ability to predict which children are on track to develop useful speech and/or are most likely to respond to language intervention. A free, publicly‐available software program and manuals are provided.

Materials and Methods: This study reports on qualitative findings from a study, involving seven adults (two female; mean age: 65 ± 8 years) and three adolescents (one female; mean age: 15 ± 2 years) with hemiparesis, evaluating the feasibility and clinical effectiveness of a home-based custom-designed virtual rehabilitation system over 2 months. Thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data from therapists' weekly telephone interview notes, research team documentation regarding issues raised during technical support interactions, and the transcript of a poststudy debriefing session involving research team members and collaborators. Results: Qualitative themes that emerged suggested that system use was associated with three key factors as follows: (1) the technology itself (e.g., characteristics of the games and their clinical implications, system accessibility, and hardware and software design); (2) communication processes (e.g., preferences and effectiveness of methods used during the study); and (3) knowledge and training of participants and therapists on the technology's use (e.g., familiarity with Facebook, time required to gain competence with the system, and need for clinical observations during remote therapy). Strategies to address these factors are proposed. Conclusion: Lessons learned from this study can inform future clinical and implementation research using commercial videogames and social media platforms. The capacity to track compensatory movements, clinical considerations in game selection, the provision of kinematic and treatment progress reports to participants, and effective communication and training for therapists and participants may enhance research success, system usability, and adoption.

Forty-four track-and-field athletes striving for selection to national games completed the Sport Imagery Questionnaire to assess imagery use and the Motivational Imagery Ability Measure to assess imagery ability. The athletes completed the measures three times within 13 months prior to the games. Although cognitive general imagery use increased over time, paired  t-tests indicated that there were no other significant changes across the functions of imagery use. For motivational imagery ability, there were minimal changes from Time 1 to Time 3 indicating the athletes’ motivational imagery ability remained relatively stable.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a diabetes mobile app with in-app coaching by a certified diabetes educator on glycemic control for individuals with type 2 diabetes. Methods: A 12 week-long single-arm intent-to-treat trial evaluated the impact of a diabetes mobile app and coaching program (One Drop | Mobile With One Drop | Experts), which facilitated tracking of self-care and included an in-app diabetes education program, on A1C for individuals with type 2 diabetes and an A1C ≥7.5% (58 mmol/mol). An online study platform (Achievement Studies, Evidation Health Inc, San Mateo, CA) was used to screen, consent, and enroll participants; collect study data; and track participants’ progress throughout the study. Baseline and study end A1C measurements as well as questionnaire data from participants were collected. Results: Participants (n = 146) were 52 ± 9 years old, 71% female, 25% black or Hispanic, diagnosed with diabetes for 11 ± 7 years, and with a mean baseline A1C of 9.87% ± 2.0 (84 mmol/mol). In adjusted repeated measures models, mean A1C improved by −0.86% among study completers (n = 127), −0.96% among active users of the app and coaching program (n = 93), and −1.32% among active users with a baseline A1C ≥9.0% (75 mmol/mol) (n = 53). Conclusions: This program was associated with a clinically meaningful and significant reduction in A1C and can potentially increase access to effective diabetes self-management education and support for individuals with diabetes.

This paper describes the development of physical and mental health summary scores for the PROMIS-29 v2.0. Method: We conducted factor analyses of PROMIS-29 scales on data collected from two internet panels ( n = 3000 and 2000). Results: Confirmatory factor analyses provided support for a physical health factor defined by physical function, pain (interference and intensity), and ability to participate in social roles and activities, and a mental health factor defined primarily by emotional distress (anxiety and depressive symptoms). Reliabilities for these two summary scores were 0.98 (physical health) and 0.97 (mental health). Correlations of the PROMIS-29 v2.0 physical and mental health summary scores with chronic conditions and other health-related quality of life measures were consistent with a priori hypotheses. Conclusions: This study develops and provides preliminary evidence supporting the reliability and validity of PROMIS-29 v2.0 physical and mental health summary scores that can be used in future studies to assess impacts of health care interventions and track changes in health over time. Further evaluation of these and alternative summary measures is recommended.

The lab-based study also recorded physiological responses using measures of pupil diameter and electrodermal activity. The study tested 14 adult respondents as they individually completed the PIAAC computer-based assessment. The eye tracking observations help to fill an ‘explanatory gap’ by providing data on variation in item response processes that are not captured by other sources of process data such as think aloud protocols or computer-generated log files. The data on fixations and saccades provided detailed information on test item response strategies, enabling profiling of respondent engagement and response processes associated with successful performance. Much of that activity does not include the use of the keyboard and mouse, and involves ‘off-screen’ use of pen and paper (and calculator) that are not captured by assessment log-files. In conclusion, this paper points toward an important application of eye tracking in large-scale assessments. This includes insights into response processes in new domains such as adaptive problem-solving that aim to identify individuals’ ability to select and combine resources from the digital and physical environment.

LeRoy, Kyle W. Murdock, Lisa M. Jaremka, Asad Loya and Christopher P. Fagundes ( Health Psychology, 2017[May], Vol 36[5], 512-520). The erratum reports the following acknowledgments that were partially omitted from the author note: Data used in this article were collected by the Laboratory for the Study of Stress, Immunity, and Disease. The data were accessed via the Common Cold Project website. Additional grants that supported the collection of these data and clinical and regulatory assistance. The full correction is listed in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2017-14291-001.) Objective: Loneliness is a well-established risk factor for poor physical health. Much less is known about how loneliness affects patient-reported outcomes (PROs), such as somatic symptoms, which are increasingly important for guiding symptom management and assessing quality of patient care. The current study investigates whether (a) loneliness and social isolation predict cold symptoms independent of each other, and (b) whether loneliness is a more robust risk factor than objective social isolation for experiencing cold symptoms. Method: As part of a larger parent study, 213 healthy participants completed the Short Loneliness Scale (LON) and the Social Network Index (SNI) at baseline. They were given nasal drops containing rhinovirus 39 (RV39; i.e., a common cold virus), then quarantined for 5 days during which they reported on subjective cold symptoms in addition to being monitored for objective indicators of infection. Data from 160 of the participants (who were infected with the virus) were used in the present analyses. Results: A hierarchical multiple regression revealed that baseline loneliness predicted self-reported cold symptoms over time (assessed via area under the curve), over and above demographic variables, season of participation, and depressive affect. Interestingly, social network size and diversity did not predict cold symptoms. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the perception of loneliness is more closely linked to self-reported illness symptoms than objectively measured social isolation. Assessing psychosocial factors such as loneliness when treating and evaluating the common cold could contribute to health care practitioners’ understanding of their patients’ experiences with acute illness.

In the original article, in figure 2, the p values should not have been reported and have been replaced with d values and associated 95% CIs.] Background: Previous research suggests that the use of outcome feedback technology can enable psychological therapists to identify and resolve obstacles to clinical improvement. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of an outcome feedback quality assurance system applied in stepped care psychological services. Methods: This multisite, open-label, cluster randomised controlled trial was done at eight National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England, involving therapists who were qualified to deliver evidence-based low-intensity or high-intensity psychological interventions. Adult patients (18 years or older) who accessed individual therapy with participating therapists were eligible for inclusion, except patients who accessed group therapies and those who attended less than two individual therapy sessions. Therapists were randomly assigned (1:1) to an outcome feedback intervention group or a treatment-as-usual control group by use of a computer-generated randomisation algorithm. The allocation of patients to therapists was quasi-random, whereby patients on waiting lists were allocated sequentially on the basis of therapist availability. All patients received low-intensity (less than eight sessions) or high-intensity (up to 20 sessions) psychological therapies for the duration of the 1-year study period. An automated computer algorithm alerted therapists in the outcome feedback group to patients who were not on track, and primed them to review these patients in clinical supervision. The primary outcome was symptom severity on validated depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7]) measures after treatment of varying durations, which were compared between groups with multilevel modelling, controlling for cluster (therapist) effects. We used an intention-to-treat approach. This trial was prospectively registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN12459454. Findings: In total, 79 therapists were recruited to the study between Jan 8, 2016, and July 15, 2016, but two did not participate. Of these participants, 39 (51%) were randomly assigned to the outcome feedback group and 38 (49%) to the control group. Overall, 2233 patients were included in the trial (1176 [53%] were treated by therapists in the outcome feedback group, and 1057 [47%] by therapists in the control group). Patients classified as not on track had less severe symptoms after treatment if they were allocated to the outcome feedback group than those in the control group (PHQ-9 d = 0·23, B = –1·03 [95% CI −1·84 to −0·23], p = 0·012; GAD-7 d = 0·19, B = –0·85 [–1·56 to −0·14], p = 0·019). Interpretation: Supplementing psychological therapy with low-cost feedback technology can reduce symptom severity in patients at risk of poor response to treatment. This evidence supports the implementation of outcome feedback in stepped care psychological services.

We used longitudinal log-file data to examine learning strategies of a large cohort ( N = 424) of university students taking an online class. Distributed learning, the use of self-tests and a better high school GPA was associated with better exam grades. The positive effect of conscientiousness on exam grades was mediated by distributed learning. Conscientious students distributed their studying over the course of the semester, which in turn, improved grades. The results provide insights into objective study behavior of online students and shed light on the question of how individual differences in cognitive and non-cognitive prerequisites shape the use of learning strategies and exam grades.

In particular, a track mobile robot is equipped with a 4-DOF robot arm to grasp objects. Operator uses one hand to control both the motion of mobile robot and the posture of robot arm via scheme of gesture polysemy method which is put forward in this paper. A sensor called leap motion (LM), which can obtain the position and posture data of hand, is employed in this system. Two filters were employed to estimate the position and posture of human hand so as to reduce the inherent noise of the sensor. Kalman filter was used to estimate the position, and particle filter was used to estimate the orientation. The advantage of the proposed method is that it is feasible to control a mobile manipulator through just one hand using a LM sensor. The effectiveness of the proposed human–robot interface was verified in laboratory with a series of experiments. And the results indicate that the proposed human–robot interface is able to track the movements of operator’s hand with high accuracy. It is found that the system can be employed by a non-professional operator for robot teleoperation.

The social media analytic tool Keyhole was used to track tweets in both Arabic and English for the hashtag #StopEnslavingSaudiWomen, over a period of one month, from 29 March 2017 to 28 April 2017. Following the application of exclusion criteria, the total number of tweets was 7,219. Tweets were then coded and analyzed using the thematic analysis (TA) approach. Final theme categories were shared common experience of subordination/shared identity, illegitimacy, cognitive alternatives, leadership, third-party support, and oppositional disruption. Results suggested that Twitter offers a means of social psychological resistance, but that this resistance is performed in ways partially determined by the affordances of the medium in question, and by the wider context of Saudi Arabian society.

Some may argue privacy is disappearing, while others may argue it is simply evolving in response to our increasingly digitized lives. A report from the Pew Research Center states that ""many of the issues, behaviors, and information we consider to be private today will not be so. Information will be even more pervasive, even more liquid, and portable. The digital private sphere, as well as the digital public sphere, will most likely completely overlap.’’ This overlapping is easily identifiable today. Every time we accept a Web site’s use of cookies to track browsing behavior, use social media platforms that make use of our personal information, and allow location services on our smartphones, we demonstrate that we are willing to give up our right to be left alone for the sake of convenience. And yet, this trade-off is a perpetual gray area. Specifically for healthcare providers, these blurred lines raise new and pressing ethical concerns. In a 2016 Pew survey, 52% of Americans said they would hypothetically accept having their health records uploaded online to a secure Web site to facilitate accessing their medical records and scheduling appointments. Respondents who found the scenario unacceptable cited security concerns, stating that no site is truly secure, and health information should remain confidential.

Our discussion addresses how characteristics of social backgrounds are salient in harnessing types of Internet use that may be a critical tipping point for information diversity.

To date, little is known about the extent to which the different features in OFCs answer to users’ motivations to exercise. This study addresses this question, by examining (1) whether there are differences in motivations for running between OFC users and non-users and (2) whether the use of particular features is driven by particular running motivations. A survey study was conducted among 717 runners, of which 57% used an OFC to support running activities. Results demonstrate that OFC users are more achievement-oriented than non-OFC users, especially regarding the attainment of personal goals. OFC users with physical motivations (e.g. weight loss) use self-regulatory features more frequently, while runners with social motivations more often use features that afford them to share activities on social media. Achievement-oriented runners appreciate features that allow them to track their progress and interact with other OFC users. No relation was found between the use of OFC features and psychological motivations for running.

Early identification of warning signs from digital footprints could facilitate adaptive and dynamic just in-time monitoring and care for individuals with common mental disorders. Methods: Self-report data on mental health and lifestyle behaviour from 120 male and female Australian young adults experiencing psychological distress were collected online. API software was used to download participant's daily activity duration measurements over eight months from linked commercial activity tracker apps and wearables in real time. An independent samples  t-test was conducted to compare the differences in daily durations of recorded physical activity between wearable devises and smartphone apps. Entropy techniques using R interpol package were used to analyse volatility in daily activity duration. Results: DASS-21 depression, stress and anxiety sub-scale scores indicated the study sample on average, had a moderate level of psychological distress. Daily activity duration was significantly greater from wearable devices when compared with smartphone apps ( t-test = 25.4, p < 0.001). Entropy indices were not related with any of the DASS-21 measures. However, significant correlation between DASS-21 anxiety subscale scores and entropy of those with over 45 days measurements ( r = 0.58, p = 0.02) was observed. Limitations: The observational nature of this study prohibits causal inference. As a convenience sample was used, the results may lack generalisability to the wider population. Conclusions: Continuous monitoring using commercial apps and wearables as a resource to help clinicians augment clinical care for common mental disorders appears viable.

In the original article, in figure 2, the p values should not have been reported and have been replaced with d values and associated 95% CIs. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-31904-025). Background: Previous research suggests that the use of outcome feedback technology can enable psychological therapists to identify and resolve obstacles to clinical improvement. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of an outcome feedback quality assurance system applied in stepped care psychological services. Methods: This multisite, open-label, cluster randomised controlled trial was done at eight National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England, involving therapists who were qualified to deliver evidence-based low-intensity or high-intensity psychological interventions. Adult patients (18 years or older) who accessed individual therapy with participating therapists were eligible for inclusion, except patients who accessed group therapies and those who attended less than two individual therapy sessions. Therapists were randomly assigned (1:1) to an outcome feedback intervention group or a treatment-as-usual control group by use of a computer-generated randomisation algorithm. The allocation of patients to therapists was quasi-random, whereby patients on waiting lists were allocated sequentially on the basis of therapist availability. All patients received low-intensity (less than eight sessions) or high-intensity (up to 20 sessions) psychological therapies for the duration of the 1-year study period. An automated computer algorithm alerted therapists in the outcome feedback group to patients who were not on track, and primed them to review these patients in clinical supervision. The primary outcome was symptom severity on validated depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7]) measures after treatment of varying durations, which were compared between groups with multilevel modelling, controlling for cluster (therapist) effects. We used an intention-to-treat approach. This trial was prospectively registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN12459454. Findings: In total, 79 therapists were recruited to the study between Jan 8, 2016, and July 15, 2016, but two did not participate. Of these participants, 39 (51%) were randomly assigned to the outcome feedback group and 38 (49%) to the control group. Overall, 2233 patients were included in the trial (1176 [53%] were treated by therapists in the outcome feedback group, and 1057 [47%] by therapists in the control group). Patients classified as not on track had less severe symptoms after treatment if they were allocated to the outcome feedback group than those in the control group (PHQ-9 d = 0·23, B = –1·03 [95% CI −1·84 to −0·23], p = 0·012; GAD-7 d = 0·19, B = –0·85 [–1·56 to −0·14], p = 0·019). Interpretation: Supplementing psychological therapy with low-cost feedback technology can reduce symptom severity in patients at risk of poor response to treatment. This evidence supports the implementation of outcome feedback in stepped care psychological services.

Many investigations into the frames journalists use when covering risks were published in recent years. Yet, keeping track of this literature has become increasingly difficult because authors tend to introduce new frames with every new study. This study reports a systematic review of studies on news frames on health risks. We pursue three central aims: (1) to determine if some of the frame-names circulating in the literature stand for very similar or even identical constructs (and can thus be condensed); (2) to determine how they relate to the four framing functions and to each other; and (3) to aggregate findings on the nature of frames in the media coverage of health risks. This should facilitate future reviews of literature and the formulation of hypotheses, substantiate discussions on the quality of risk reporting, add nuance to what has been a blanket criticism of the media, and help building framing theory by improving its consistency. We found 45 frame-names for just 15 frames, and a tendency to delineate frames for each framing function; some frames were unrelated to the framing functions. The frames that drew most scholarly interest were also the ones employed most often by journalists. Some generalisable statements regarding the use of frames in health-risk reporting can be made, though caution is advised given gaps in the evidence and variations by health risk and/or country of study.

Because distracted driving also affects older drivers, who can have seriously compromised vision, we also analysed the associations between visual-function parameters and driving performance. A total of 75 drivers, experienced in sending WhatsApp messages (≥ 10WhatsApp messages/week), participated in this study and were divided into four age categories. Visual-function tests included contrast sensitivity with and without glare, retinal straylight and objective assessment of optical quality. Simulated driving performance was assessed under a baseline driving condition (without distraction) as well as a texting condition (WhatsApp messages) while driving. The participants used their own mobile phone. Lastly, objective results of driving performance were compared with subjective self-report data from the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ). The analysis indicated that functional changes occurring with age, such as a lower contrast sensitivity and greater retinal straylight, were correlated with a higher number of collisions, longer distances driven outside the lane, and greater standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP). The results showed a significant main effect of age for the driving-performance parameters. Also, compared to the baseline, texting WhatsApp messages while driving worsens driving performance for all age groups, most notably among older participants. Thus, the older drivers' SDLP was ∼14% higher than that for the baseline average of all the other drivers and rose to 29% under distraction, reflecting the impact of secondary tasks. The negative effect of the use of the smartphone during driving was also reflected in the number of collisions, with a greater risk of accidents in all the groups of drivers (by 8.3% for young adults, 25.0% for adults, 80.5% for middle-aged adults, and 134.5% for older drivers). Lastly, participants' subjective responses indicated that younger drivers (18–24 years) had a higher risk of deliberately violating safe driving practices (p < 0.05). The present study demonstrates that texting WhatsApp messages while driving significantly impairs the ability to drive safely, with older drivers being the group most adversely affected. It would be recommendable to include other nonstandard vision tests, which have shown associations with driving performance, in the examination for driver licensing. This would help raise the awareness of older drivers concerning their visual limitations, permitting them to adopt compensatory measures to improve their driving safety.

Capitalizing on an original survey administered to seniors (fourth-year secondary school students), our survey data ( N = 972) come from a large American public high school with a predominantly disadvantaged student body. The school’s elective tracking system and inadequate digital resources make for an excellent case study of the effects of a differentiated curriculum and digital inequalities on academic achievement. Multilevel random-effects and fixed-effects regression models applied to the survey data reveal the important role played by digital inequalities in shaping academic achievement as measured by GPA. As the models establish, academic achievement is positively correlated with both duration of digital experience and usage intensity regarding academically useful computing activities, even when students’ curricular and class placement are taken into account. In contrast, both leisure computing and smartphone usage are negatively correlated with academic achievement as measured by GPA. Also with regard to GPA, findings show that students in the higher curricular tracks benefit more from longer durations of digital experience than do students in lower curricular tracks. These results underscore the importance of focusing attention on the ways in which digital inequalities combine with curricular tracking in shaping academic achievement.

In particular, such new insights may be revealed by time-tamped actions, which are recorded as computer log-files in the assessments. These actions, nested in individual level, are logically interconnected. This interdependency can be modeled straightforwardly in a multi-level framework. This study draws on process data recorded in one of complex problem-solving tasks (Traffic CP007Q02) in Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012 and proposes a modified Multilevel Mixture IRT model (MMixIRT) to explore the problem-solving strategies. It was found that the model can not only explore whether the latent classes differ in their response strategies at the process level, but provide ability estimates at both the process level and the student level. The two level abilities are different across latent classes, and they are related to operational variables such as the number of resets or clicks. The proposed method may allow for better exploration of students' specific strategies for solving a problem, and the strengths and weaknesses of the strategies. Such findings may be further used to design targeted instructional interventions.

It remains unknown to what extent and in what respect serious gaming during the regular outpatient rehabilitation can contribute to health outcomes. Objective: The objectives of our study were to determine the effect of additional serious gaming on (1) physical and emotional functioning in general; (2) particular outcome domains; and (3) patient global impressions of change, general health, and functioning and to determine (4) the dependency of serious gaming effects on adherence. Methods: We conducted a naturalistic quasi-experiment using embedded qualitative methods. The intervention group patients received an additional guided (mindfulness-based) serious gaming intervention during weeks 9-12 of a 16-week rehabilitation program at 2 sites of a Dutch rehabilitation clinic. Simultaneously, 119 control group patients followed the same program without serious gaming at 2 similar sites of the same clinic. Data consisted of 10 semistructured patient interviews and routinely collected patient self-reported outcomes. First, multivariate linear mixed modeling was used to simultaneously estimate a group effect on the outcome change between weeks 8 and 16 in 4 primary outcomes: current pain intensity, fatigue, pain catastrophizing, and psychological distress. Second, similar univariate linear mixed models were used to estimate effects on particular (unstandardized) outcomes. Third, secondary outcomes (ie, global impression of change, general health, functioning, and treatment satisfaction) were compared between the groups using independent t tests. Finally, subgroups were established according to the levels of adherence using log data. Influences of observed confounding factors were considered throughout analyses. Results: Of 329 eligible patients, 156 intervention group and 119 control group patients (N = 275) with mostly chronic back pain and concomitant psychosocial problems participated in this study. Of all, 119 patients played ≥75% of the game. First, the standardized means across the 4 primary outcomes showed a significantly more favorable degree of change during the second part of the treatment for the intervention group than for the control group (beta = −0.119, SE = 0.046,  P = .009). Second, the intervention group showed a greater outcome change in depressive mood (b = −2.748, SE = 1.072, P = .011) but not in “insufficiency” or concentration problems. Third, no significant group effects on secondary outcomes were found. Fourth, adherence was generally high and invariant. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest a very small favorable average effect on relevant health outcomes of additional serious gaming during multidisciplinary rehabilitation. The indication that serious gaming could be a relatively time-efficient component warrants further research into if, when, how, and for which patients serious gaming could be cost-effective in treatment and why.

Several small studies have shown promise in predicting mood variability from smartphone‐based sensor and usage data, but have not been generalized to nationally recruited samples. This study used passive smartphone data, demographic characteristics, and baseline depressive symptoms to predict prospective daily mood. Method Daily phone usage data were collected passively from 271 Android phone users participating in a fully remote randomized controlled trial of depression treatment (BRIGHTEN). Participants completed daily Patient Health Questionnaire‐2. A machine learning approach was used to predict daily mood for the entire sample and individual participants. Results Sample‐wide estimates showed a marginally significant association between physical mobility and self‐reported daily mood (B = –0.04, P < 0.05), but the predictive models performed poorly for the sample as a whole (median R2 ∼ 0). Focusing on individuals, 13.9% of participants showed significant association (FDR < 0.10) between a passive feature and daily mood. Personalized models combining features provided better prediction performance (median area under the curve [AUC] > 0.50) for 80.6% of participants and very strong prediction in a subset (median AUC > 0.80) for 11.8% of participants. Conclusions Passive smartphone data with current features may not be suited for predicting daily mood at a population level because of the high degree of intra‐ and interindividual variation in phone usage patterns and daily mood ratings. Personalized models show encouraging early signs for predicting an individual's mood state changes, with GPS‐derived mobility being the top most important feature in the present sample.

The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility and validity of an EMA protocol to assess older adults’ PA and SB. Feasibility was determined by examining factors associated with EMA survey compliance and if PA or SB were impacted by EMA survey compliance. Validity was determined by comparing EMA-reported PA and SB to objectively measured PA and SB at the EMA prompt. Over 10 days, older adults ( n = 104; Agerange = 60–98 years) received 6 randomly prompted EMA questionnaires on a smartphone each day and wore an ActivPAL activity monitor to provide a device-based measure of PA and SB. Participants reported whether they were currently engaged in PA or SB. Older adults were compliant with the EMA and ActivPAL protocol on 92% of occasions. Differences in EMA compliance differed by weight status. Among overweight and obese older adults EMA compliance differed by sex (OR = 3.15, 95% CI: 1.43, 6.92) and day of week (OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.33, 2.41). Among normal weight older adults, EMA compliance differed by time of day (OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.30). EMA compliance did not differ for device-based PA or SB in the 15 min before versus the 15 min after the EMA prompt, suggesting that these behaviors did not influence likelihood of responding and responding did not influence these behaviors ( ps > 0.05). When PA was reported through EMA, participants engaged in less device-based PA in the 15 min after compared to the 15 min before the EMA prompt ( p = 0.01), suggesting possible reactance or a disruption of PA. EMA-reported PA and SB were positively associated with higher device-based PA and SB in the ±15 min, respectively, supporting criterion validity ( ps < 0.05). The assessment of older adults’ PA and SB through EMA is feasible and valid, although there may be PA reactance to EMA prompting. Therefore, EMA represents a significant methodological tool that can aid in our understanding of the environmental, social, and psychological processes regulating older adults’ PA and SB in the context of everyday life.

Lifestyle interventions (e.g., diet, exercise, stress management) to reduce blood pressure (BP) are often complex with varying effectiveness. Breathing awareness meditation (BAM) is a stress management strategy with encouraging effects on BP, though widespread dissemination is hampered by the lack of an easy-to-use methodology to train and monitor BAM practices. A smartphone application (Tension Tamer [TT]) that implements BAM and tracks adherence has shown promise in addressing these gaps. This 6-month dose-response feasibility trial evaluated effects of the app on BP to further optimize BAM user guidelines. Methods: Sixty-four adults with prehypertension were randomized to complete TT-guided BAM sessions for 5-, 10-, or 15-min intervals twice daily over 6 months. Continuous heart rate readings derived from the phone’s video camera via reflective photoplethysmography were used as feedback and as an index of time-stamped adherence. Outcomes (resting BP, HR) were collected at baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6-months. Results: Mixed modeling results showed a significant time effect for systolic BP (SBP) with a dose-response effect at Months 3 and 6. Adherence declined over time and was lowest in the 15-min dose condition, though SBP reductions were maintained. Generally, adherence was negatively associated with dose as the study progressed. Conclusions: Smartphone-implemented BAM appears to reduce SBP and can be a low-cost method to reach large populations.

This format presents a potentially challenging reading situation as the text must be followed smoothly to the left (to track individual words) while rightward eye movements are made as usual to progress through the text. This conflict may reduce attention allocated to upcoming text. Returning to previously encountered text is also more difficult with this format. Here, a sustained reading comprehension task was used to compare performance with horizontally scrolling and multi-line static text formats. Results showed that literal comprehension can be reasonably well maintained with scrolling text, although small decrements are seen at faster scrolling rates. However, they indicated that this format makes it more difficult to answer questions requiring an inference to be made. The contribution of working memory capacity and the impact of display speed on these effects were considered. These findings have implications for the application of this format in digital media and also more widely for the conditions required for successful in-depth reading comprehension with any text format.

Methods: Data were collected in an observational study of healthy adults ( n = 79) residing in the New York City metro area who were studied for 365 days from 2014 to 2015. Sedentary behavior was objectively measured via accelerometry. A smartphone-based electronic diary was used to assess level of stress (“Overall, how stressful was your day?” 0–10 scale) and sources of stress. Results: The end-of-day stress rating was not associated with total sedentary time ( B = −1.34, p = .767) at the group level.When specific sources of stress were evaluated at the group level, argument-related stress was associated with increased sedentariness, whereas running late- and work-related stress were associated with decreased sedentariness. There was a substantial degree of interindividual variability in the relationship of stress with sedentary behavior. Both the level and sources of stress were associated with increased sedentariness for some, decreased sedentariness for others, and had no effect for many (within-person variance p < .001). Conclusions: These findings suggest that the influence of stress on sedentary behavior varies by source of stress and from person to person. A precision medicine approach may bewarranted to target reductions in sedentary time, although further studies are needed to confirm the observed findings in light of study limitations including a small sample size and enrollment of participants from a single, urban metropolitan area.

We assessed objective smartphone use by daily minutes of screen time and number of phone screen unlocks. One hundred and one undergraduate university students participated. Bivariate correlations and latent growth curve analyses showed that PSU severity related to screen time minutes, but not to phone screen unlocking. Depression and anxiety severity were not related to screen time minutes, but negatively correlated with frequency of phone screen unlocking. Additionally, daily depressive mood items did not, in general, predict objective smartphone use for the corresponding day. However, average daily depressive mood over one week positively correlated with PSU levels. These findings and their implications are discussed.

These findings have been demonstrated using self-reported behaviour measures. In this study, we aimed to test the bi-dimensional attitude-behaviour relationship using objectively measured speeding behaviour derived from a driving simulator and test if the asymmetrical prediction of behaviour from the positive and negative attitude dimensions could be explained by attitude accessibility (how available an attitude is in memory and therefore how readily it is able to guide behaviour). One hundred and six drivers completed online measures of the positive and negative dimensions of their attitudes towards exceeding the speed limit. Response latency measures of the accessibilities of both dimensions were also taken. A driving simulator was used to measure speeding behaviour. Both attitude dimensions independently predicted speeding, with the positive dimension being the stronger predictor. The positive attitude dimension was also more accessible than was the negative dimension. The difference in the accessibilities of the positive and negative attitude dimensions significantly mediated the difference in their predictive validities. The results demonstrate that the positive attitude dimension is the principle predictor of speeding and a reason for this is that it is more accessible in memory than is the negative attitude dimension. Road safety interventions (e.g., education) that aim to reduce speeding and associated traffic crashes might usefully decrease the valence or accessibility of the positive attitude dimension. There would also appear to be scope to reduce speeding by increasing the valence or accessibility of the negative attitude dimension.

Methods: Participants completed an online survey asking about their sex, body dissatisfaction, neuroticism, and use of apps that track calories. Results: Analyses revealed that female sex and body dissatisfaction—but not neuroticism—were direct predictors of calorie-tracking app usage. Analyses also provided support for a causal sequence wherein neuroticism and body dissatisfaction mediate, in serial, the relationship between female sex and calorie-tracking app usage. Conclusions: The results from this study suggest that female college students are more likely to use calorie-tracking apps—a phenomenon which may be attributable to their higher levels of neuroticism and subsequent increased body dissatisfaction.

This study investigated whether the use of digital wearable technology (Fitbits, along with synced iPads) can affect health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in AYA aged patients with cancer. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective cohort study that offered Fitbits and iPads to all AYA patients aged 15 to 29 at an academic medical center at the time of cancer diagnosis. Patients completed the Short Form Health Survey developed by RAND (RAND-36) assessing eight dimensions of HRQOL on entering the study and at the time of their 6-month follow-up or the end of treatment, whichever occurred first. At the time of follow-up, patients also completed a questionnaire that assessed user experience, including frequency of wearable device use, enjoyment, challenges, and participation, in online communities. Results: Thirty-three patients participated in the study. Most patients reported enjoying the digital technology and using the devices to track multiple aspects of their health (85%). Most also reported a subjective increase in physical activity (79%). After the intervention, participants demonstrated significant improvements across all eight dimensions of HRQOL measured by the RAND-36 ( p < 0.00 to 0.01). Conclusion: Distributing wearable technology at the time of diagnosis may provide an avenue for improving HRQOL in adolescents and young adults with cancer.

Prior studies have found psychopathology correlated with frequency of smartphone use. However, this research relied on cross-sectional data and solely utilized subjectively reported smartphone use. These methodological shortcomings should be overcome to understand a truer picture of the association between increased smartphone use and psychopathology. Utilizing an intensive repeated measures study design, we used a smartphone application (app) to monitor daily minutes of smartphone use over the course of one week among 68 college students. Using latent growth curve modeling, we found that lower depression severity predicted increased smartphone use over the week. Additionally, greater use of expressive suppression as an emotion regulation strategy predicted more baseline smartphone use, but less smartphone use during the week. These findings suggest that depression and expressive suppression of emotions accounted for significant variability in objectively measured smartphone use. Depression and emotion regulation are discussed in regard to corresponding patterns of smartphone usage. This paper contributes to knowledge of psychopathological correlates of smartphone use by repeated, objective smartphone use measurement.

Methods: A total of 334 PD, 104 iRBD, and 84 control participants performed 7 tasks to evaluate voice, balance, gait, finger tapping, reaction time, rest tremor, and postural tremor. Smartphone recordings were collected both in clinic and at home under noncontrolled conditions over several days. All participants underwent detailed parallel in-clinic assessments. Using only the smartphone sensor recordings, we sought to (1) discriminate whether the participant had iRBD or PD and (2) identify which of the above 7 motor tasks were most salient in distinguishing groups. Results: Statistically significant differences based on these 7 tasks were observed between the 3 groups. For the 3 pairwise discriminatory comparisons, (1) controls vs iRBD, (2) controls vs PD, and (3) iRBD vs PD, the mean sensitivity and specificity values ranged from 84.6% to 91.9%. Postural tremor, rest tremor, and voice were the most discriminatory tasks overall, whereas the reaction time was least discriminatory. Conclusions: Prodromal forms of PD include the sleep disorder iRBD, where subtle motor impairment can be detected using clinician-based rating scales (e.g., Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale), which may lack the sensitivity to detect and track granular change. Consumer grade smartphones can be used to accurately separate not only iRBD from controls but also iRBD from PD participants, providing a growing consensus for the utility of digital biomarkers in early and prodromal PD.

This article examines informal, out-of-class engagement with a MALL tool: Duolingo. After being invited to use Duolingo, 118 higher education language students agreed to have their activity in the application tracked. In addition to the data collected from the Duolingo dashboard, questionnaires, as well as semi-structured interviews, were implemented. Results viewed from Garrison’s dimensions of self-directed learning (motivation, self-management and self-monitoring) reveal inconsistencies between what students think about the app and what they do with it. Questionnaires suggest that Duolingo can encourage out-of-class learning through fun activities, but interviews reveal a lack of sustained motivation, self-monitoring and self-management reflected in the low usage of the application. Tracking data reveals that students lack the time for out-of-class MALL during course weeks and are more active during holidays. The results highlight the importance of a context in which users are encouraged to take responsibility for their learning. However, most students will, besides encouragement, also need training and support for their self-directed learning.

With the advancement in technology, games have been revolutionizing at each step per the emerging and variant interests of players. Recently, machine learning techniques are used for the generation of game content based on player's experience. The dynamic content generation in computer games based on player's experience and feedback is still a challenging task. This requires measurement of entertainment factor achieved by a player during a game. In order to measure entertainment factor, we need to incorporate human‐computer interaction by evolution of game content with respect to player's response. Optimization techniques can be used for the measurement of entertainment factor and for the generation of dynamic game content. The use of computational intelligence techniques in game development can lead to a new domain called “computational intelligence in games.” This research is focused on car racing game genre, and the paradigm selected for dynamicity is track generation of car racing game. It requires player profiling and classification of players. The optimization of track generation has been performed by using single and multiobjective genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization. Initially, classification of player's rank based on data and theory‐driven approaches has been performed. Moreover, 3 different techniques of defining ranges or boundaries of race parameters for player's rank classification are studied. The techniques are based on crisp values, neural network, and fuzzy inference process. Then, an entertainment quantifier technique is proposed for a player after playing a certain number of games based on dynamic content generation using multiobjective genetic algorithm using standard Pareto optimal front and an epsilon (ϵ) front. In conclusion, the method proposed for quantifying entertainment can be used to analyze and classify the trend in interests of a player according to which the game itself can dynamically generate. This will keep the interest of player intact and provides maximum entertainment experience per the interest of an individual. The proposed solution can easily be used in generation of any game content and can effectively be used in accurate measurement of entertaining factor of any game.

Design: This cross-sectional study used data from 4971 Hispanic/Latinos, 18–74 years, who participated in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) baseline exam and the HCHS/SOL Sociocultural Ancillary Study. Three objectively measured cardiovascular disease risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) were included. Wealth was measured using an adapted version of the  Home Affluence Scale, which included questions regarding the ownership of a home, cars, computers, and recent vacations. Results: After adjusting for traditional socioeconomic indicators (income, employment, education), and other covariates, we found that wealth was not associated with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia or obesity. Analyses by sex showed that middle-wealth women were less likely to have hypercholesterolemia or obesity. Analyses by Hispanic/Latino background groups showed that while wealthier Central Americans were less likely to have obesity, wealthier Puerto Ricans were more likely to have obesity. Conclusion: This is the first study to explore the relationship between wealth and health among Hispanic/Latinos of diverse backgrounds, finding only partial evidence of this association. Future studies should utilize more robust measures of wealth, and address mechanisms by which wealth may impact health status among Hispanic/Latinos of diverse backgrounds in longitudinal designs.

Early adolescent boys ( n = 508) in middle schools completed survey measures of WCB and sociocultural pressures and objective assessment of body mass index as body composition. Multinomial logistic regressions revealed that sixth graders were more likely than seventh and eighth graders to be trying to lose weight. Moreover, greater pressure to gain weight and lower pressure to exercise predicted a greater likelihood of trying to gain weight. The significant roles of grade levels and different sociocultural pressures in predicting WCBs suggest that health professionals and school staff should consider these factors when intervening with early adolescent boys.

This implies that instead of storing visual information in working memory the information may be equally retrieved by appropriate eye movements. Given this assumption, the question arises, how we balance the effort of memorization with the effort of visual sampling our environment. We analyzed eye-tracking data in a sensorimotor task where participants had to produce a copy of a LEGO®-blocks-model displayed on a computer screen. In the unconstrained condition, the model appeared immediately after eye-fixation on the model. In the constrained condition, we introduced a 0.7 s delay before uncovering the model. The model disappeared as soon as participants made a saccade outside of the Model Area. To successfully copy a model of 8 blocks participants made saccades to the Model Area on average 7.9 times in the unconstrained condition and 5.2 times in the constrained condition. However, the mean duration of a trial was 2.9 s (14%) longer in the constrained condition even when taking into account the delayed visibility of the model. In this study, we found evidence for an adaptive shift in subjects’ behavior toward memorization by introducing a price for a certain type of saccades.

However, little has been done to examine different patterns of students with different SRL profiles over time, which precludes providing optimal on-going instructional support for individual students. To address the gap in research, we applied learning analytics to analyze log data from 284 undergraduate students enrolled in an asynchronous online statistics course. Specifically, we identified student SRL profiles, and examined the actual student SRL learning patterns. The k-medoids clustering identified three self-regulated learning profiles: self-regulation, partial self-regulation, and non-self-regulation. Self-regulated students showed more study regularity and help-seeking, than did the other two groups of students. The partially self-regulated students showed high study regularity but inactive help-seeking, while the non-self-regulated students exhibited less study regularity and less frequent help-seeking than the other two groups; their self-reported time management scores were significantly lower. The analysis of each week's log variables using the random forest algorithm revealed that self-regulated students studied course content early before exams and sought help during the general exam period, whereas non-self-regulated students studied the course content during the general exam period. Based on our findings, we provide instructional strategies that can be used to support student SRL. We also discuss implications of this study for advanced learning analytics research, and the design of effective asynchronous online courses.

Updating the traditional methodologies in this field might produce new insights. We used in situ captured data (eye-tracking data acquired with a mobile device) to study the influences of landscape composition on the landscape perceptions and valuations of city dwellers. Our goal was to compare the information provided by three sets of in situ data collected during a landscape valuation experiment: (a) evaluations of landscape quality collected through rating scales, (b) discourse data resulting from answers to open questions focused on landscape quality, and (c) eye-tracking data recorded when landscape quality assessments were made. We considered three scenes located along a green promenade that borders an urban river (the Yzeron River, France). Thirty riverine residents of this river participated in our experiment. The results revealed strong concordance among the rating, verbal and gaze data (based on gaze fixations). The gaze data helped identify landscape objects of importance in forming judgments of landscape valuation, and we obtained new insights into qualifying the impacts of nature on the perceptions and valuations of city dwellers. The natural section of the river is where we observed distinct gaze behaviors that can be interpreted as signs of fascination, which is known to promote attention recovery. We conclude that the restoration of the natural states of rivers in cities is likely to be important for increasing urban well-being.

Little has been reported on the development of these technologies. Introduction: To address this gap, we offer a case report of users' experiences with a prototype “smart” cigarette case that automatically tracks time and location of smoking. Small-scale user-experience studies are typical of iterative product design and are especially helpful when proposing novel ideas. The purpose of the study was to assess concept acceptability and potential for further development. Materials and Methods: We tested the prototype case with a small sample of potential users (n = 7). Participants used the hardware/software for 2 weeks and reconvened for a 90-min focus group to discuss experiences and provide feedback. Results: Participants liked the smart case in principle but found the prototype too bulky for easy portability. The potential for the case to convey positive messages about self also emerged as a finding. Participants indicated willingness to pay for improved technology (USD $15–$60 on a one-time basis). Discussion: The smart case is a viable concept, but design detail is critical to user acceptance. Future research should examine designs that maximize convenience and that explore the device's ability to cue intentions and other cognitions that would support cessation. Conclusions: This study is the first to our knowledge to report formative research on the smart case concept. This initial exploration provides insights that may be helpful to other developers of JITAI-support technology.

An experiment (N = 184) was conducted to answer these questions using a 3 (comment valence: positive vs. negative vs. control) × 2 (laugh track: present vs. absent) between-subjects design.

Methods: A cluster randomised wait-list controlled trial in public sector organisations in Northern Ireland. We randomly assigned clusters (1:1) using a computer generated random sequence. Researchers were masked to allocation, but participants were not. Employees aged 18–65 years with no self-reported medical contraindications to physical activity were included. The Physical Activity Loyalty Scheme (PAL) intervention was based on high-street loyalty cards where participants earned points for minutes of activity that could be redeemed for rewards, complemented by evidence-based behaviour change techniques. The primary outcome was objectively measured mean steps/day at 6 months using a validated pedometer (Yamax Digi-Walker CW-701) over 7 days, assessed with intention to treat analysis. Secondary outcomes included health, mental wellbeing, quality of life, work absenteeism and presenteeism, and use of healthcare resources. Cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit and mediation analyses were conducted. Trial registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN17975376. Results: Between September 2014 and October 2015, we recruited and randomly assigned 37 clusters (from nine organisations; mean clusters per organisation = four) and 853 participants to the intervention (n = 19 with 457 participants) or control group (n = 18 with 396 participants). Primary outcome data were available for 249 (54·4%) intervention and 236 (59·6%) control participants. Mean steps/day were significantly lower in the intervention vs control group (adjusted mean difference = −336, 95% CI: -612 to −60,  p = 0·02) at 6 months. Participants redeemed only 39% (SD 43%) of their earned points. Using the Quality Adjusted Life Year outcome, the intervention was not cost effective from an NHS/PSS perspective. A net cost analysis from an employer perspective demonstrated the intervention group was associated with a mean of 2·97 h less absenteeism over a 4 week period (p = 0·62), which could result in net savings ranging from £66 to £735 depending on the wage rate employed. At 4-weeks post-baseline there were significant increases in identified regulation, integrated regulation, intrinsic motivation, social norms and intentions in intervention compared to control participants. Conclusions: Our mixed results pose challenges that are too infrequently exposed in public heath intervention trials. Although the intervention successfully altered several hypothesised mediating constructs it did not translate into long-term behaviour change. Our incentive level may have been too low to incentivise change, despite being designed a priori by a Contingent Valuation Survey. There were also major re-structuring of several organisations which presented significant implementation challenges, and technical limitations.

Since then, data to track disease outbreak has been researched in every form from search engine queries (Ginsberg et al., 2009) to restaurant reservations (Nsoesie, Buckeridge, & Brownstein, 2014). Detecting a sudden disease outbreak, such as a rapidly spreading epidemic or a chemical or biological attack from any malevolent entity, could require a big data solution to process large streams of incoming data. This study asked the question at what point would a traditional receiving website be overwhelmed with too much data and a big data solution be required? In addition, the study sought to understand what type of social media data would be best for this purpose? The study used a simulated computing platform to provide a messaging environment that could generate simulated traffic to test the level of the transition point between traditional data capture and big data processing. The results of the analysis of the collected data showed that both traditional and big data solutions are sufficient during slower levels of incoming messaging capture, but will overwhelm traditional cluster processing as messaging levels increase. Big data solutions are more likely to stay stable as messaging traffic increases.

"JPNAZIIJ","thesis","2019","King, Jennifer","Privacy, disclosure, and social exchange theory","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2130088578?accountid=14026","Maintaining the privacy of one's personal information---one's choice of when to disclose it and to whom, how one maintains control over it, and the risks of disclosure---is one of the most important social issues of the internet era. For the past decade, privacy researchers have focused on several domains, including: documenting public opinion about privacy attitudes and expectations; understanding how user interfaces affect disclosure; and focusing on understanding interpersonal privacy dynamics within social media settings, to name a few. All of this work shares the goal of furthering our collective understanding of how people think about information privacy in online settings, what they expect when disclosing their personal information, and why they make the disclosure choices they make. A common element missing from the extant privacy research is an accounting of social structures. More specifically, as researchers consider the various factors that affect personal disclosure, they often do not consider the relationship between the discloser and the recipient, and how aspects of that relationship may directly or indirectly affect one's decision to disclose. A specific form of relationship I examine here is that between individuals and the companies to whom they disclose their personal information. This dissertation explores how the structure of relationships between individuals and companies influences individuals' decisions to disclose personal information. I accomplish this though a mixed-methods approach; first, I conducted twenty exploratory qualitative interviews with ten users of the 23andMe genetic testing service and ten women who used mobile apps to track their pregnancies. I interviewed all twenty participants about their experiences using online search engines. I then conducted three online survey experiments, using a hypothetical wearable fitness device that collects personal information as the premise of the study. The experiments tested a set of hypotheses and further explored themes that emerged from the qualitative research. These studies examine the ways in which the relationship between individuals and the companies they disclose to, and in particular the distribution of power within the relationship, affects the individuals' decisions to disclose. I use social exchange theory (SET) as the theoretical framework for this inquiry because the transfer of personal information in exchange for a service is an exchange between social actors. Thus, SET provides an empirically tested scaffolding for exploring key features of these relationships and their impact on the normative aspects of exchange that affectdisclosure choices, specifically: individuals' perceptions of trust, fairness, power, and privacy. This dissertation forges new ground in the analysis of information privacy and personal disclosure. Namely, the results of my mixed-method studies demonstrate the utility of the relational analytic approach for identifying social structural factors that affect personal disclosure. Further, it demonstrates the influence of power on personal disclosure---the extent to which individuals can control the terms under which personal information is exchanged, the options available to them to obtain similar resources elsewhere, how fair the exchange is, and the extent to which individuals benefit from it. This approach yields a different set of insights into the dynamic of personal disclosure and information privacy. It reveals the impact of power differentials on personal disclosure, demonstrating that imbalances in power between individuals and companies can affect individual decisions to disclose.

"8U8276WF","thesis","2019","Li, Xiaoye","""Seeing through consumers' eyes"": Exploring online restaurant selection behaviors using eye-tracking technology","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2148330213?accountid=14026","With the advancement of the Internet and information technology, consumers have access to a massive amount of information before purchase. In the hospitality industry, consumers frequently search online information to make decisions. However, there has been limited hospitality research exploring the actual information search behaviors in the online setting. The purpose of this research was to assess the actual information search behaviors of consumers when choosing restaurants through consumer review websites. To accomplish the purpose, three mixed-methods were used including eye-tracking experiments (Phase I), qualitative, retrospective think-aloud (RTA) interviews (Phase II), and a scenario-based survey (Phase III). In the eye-tracking experiments, 30 participants were recruited and instructed to conduct restaurant search tasks. Variables included fixation duration, fixation count, and visit count, indicating how long and how often consumers' attention had been attracted to certain information areas. The eye-tracking data was also visualized through heat maps and gaze plots. Following eye-tracking experiments, RTA interviews were conducted to investigate the underlying thinking process of consumers. A playback of the recorded eye-tracking video was presented to each participant while participants verbalized their thinking process and reasoning of information search behaviors. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed through grounded-theory model to identify important information elements. To overcome the limited generalizability of the eye-tracking experiments and interviews, a scenario-based survey was created, and seven hypotheses were developed to evaluate impacts of online reviews, images, and advertisements on consumers' interests and restaurant visit intentions based on the results of Phases I and II. Restaurant selection scenarios were provided to the participants to look through screenshots of webpages in order to mimic the online environment. The online survey company Amazon MTurk was used for data collection. A total of 406 usable survey responses were collected and analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-sample Chi-square tests, and visualized heat maps. Eye-tracking experiment results revealed that images, consumer reviews, and filter functions were the top information areas to which consumers paid considerable attention. Advertisements in Yelp also received much attention from participants, but during RTA interviews, advertisements were found to be less impactful for consumers' decision-making than the number of reviews, images with food items, and consumer reviews. Five out of seven hypotheses in Phase III were supported, indicating that it was mostly consistent with findings of the eye-tracking experiments and interviews (Phase I and II). Specifically, consumers' interests and intentions to visit restaurants were greater for restaurants with a higher number of reviews, food images, and without advertisements. Consumers also were more interested in extremely rated reviews and preferred evenly-distributed image groups. This study contributes to the existing hospitality literature related to consumer behavior with the utilization of the innovative, combined methods of eye-tracking technology, RTA interviews, and scenario-based survey. This approach allowed the researcher to obtain a holistic view of actual consumer behavior, thinking process accompanying the behavior as well as the verification with large sample. Consumer review websites and restaurateurs were provided with specific recommendations to enhance the online user experience and improve customer satisfaction, respectively.

S. women","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2157568877?accountid=14026","INTRODUCTION: Almost one-half of all pregnant women in the U.S. exceed the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) gestational weight gain (GWG) guidelines. Healthy GWG is critical for reducing adverse health outcomes associated with excessive GWG for the mother and infant. Electronic health (e-health) interventions delivered through mobile apps and websites hold potential as readily available resources for targeting health behaviors and monitoring GWG during pregnancy. The development of the Healthy Motivations for Moms-To-Be (HM2B) intervention was informed by health behavior theories, a systematic review of existing in-person and technology mediated interventions (Aim 1 of this dissertation), and results of an online needs assessment (Aim 2) of pregnant women's weight-related knowledge, behaviors, interests in various e-health intervention components. Participants were randomized to receive one of two intervention conditions (Aim 3). Participants in the Healthy Eating and Physical Activity (HEPA) condition received targeted GWG goals (based on pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index (BMI)), as well as evidence-based behavioral strategies to encourage healthy GWG, while the comparison condition received content related to Stress Reduction and Management (SRAM) techniques to reduce overall stress levels during pregnancy. Participants used a study website to track individual health behaviors and outcomes respective of their study conditions, access informational podcasts, and read weekly tips for having a healthy pregnancy. The website was developed by the TecHealth Center. In addition, participants were assigned to a group of 8-10 other pregnant women and virtually connected through a commercially-available free mobile app called MakeMe, for 12 consecutive weeks. Each week, participants were provided a behavioral goal to aim for on 5 of the 7 days during the week. Social support elements (i.e., comments and ""thumbs up"" to teammates' activity) were included in the mobile app to encourage participation, social support, and maintenance of the behavioral goal. The purpose of this study was determine the impact of a mobile health intervention, Healthy Motivations for Moms-To-Be (HM2B), targeting healthy eating and physical activity (HEPA) on GWG and increase the proportion of women who gain within the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) guidelines for healthy gestational weight gain (GWG). METHODS: Healthy pregnant women (N=140) living in the U.S. were recruited through social media to participate in a randomized controlled electronic health intervention, which consisted of a mobile app for facilitating group-based healthy behavior challenges and a website for tracking health outcomes (i.e., GWG). The intervention condition targeted HEPA behaviors during pregnancy, while the comparison condition focused on stress reduction and management during pregnancy. Pre-pregnancy weight and weight at delivery were self-reported to determine GWG in relation to IOM guidelines. Participants completed online surveys at baseline (<20 weeks) and upon completion of the 12 week group-based intervention. Surveys included the Rapid Eating Assessment for Participants-Shortened (REAP-S) scale for measuring typical dietary intake. RESULTS: Participants who completed their delivery outcomes survey were included in the analysis (n=87). The sample was predominately white (81.6%) and highly educated (advanced degree beyond Bachelor's; 58.6%). Regarding adherence to IOM guidelines, there was a promising but not significant difference in the proportion of women gaining adequate weight in the intervention versus comparison group (36% vs. 25%) or in the proportion of women who exceeded IOM guidelines (43% vs. 53%, respectively, p=0.42). There was a significant difference observed in post-intervention healthy eating behaviors reported between groups (F (1,87)=4.07, p=0.047), where HEPA participants… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)","2019","2020-06-05 21:18:51","2020-06-05 21:18:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of South Carolina","","English","","Ph.D.","APA PsycInfo®","2157568877; 2018-58621-036","","","Publication Title: Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering AAI10842029","","","http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:APA+PsycInfo%C2%AE&atitle=&title=Healthy+motivations+for+moms-to-be+%28healthy+mom2b%29+study%3A+A+mobile+health+intervention+targeting+gestational+weight+gain+among+U.+S.+women&issn=&date=2019-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Dahl%2C+Alicia+Anne&isbn=978-0438554078&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2018-58621-036&rft_id=info:doi/","Female; Intervention; Human; Empirical Study; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Quantitative Study; US; 3300:Health & Mental Health Treatment & Prevention; Weight Gain; Health Care Psychology; gestational weight gain; healthy moms; healthy motivations; mobile health intervention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"XEUMNKVD","thesis","2019","Scott, Ashling Michelle","Essays in behavioral economics","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2162886554?accountid=14026","Economic theory hinges on the fact that humans are rational. However, in the wild, research demonstrates human behavior often deviates from rationality. This deviation may result in suboptimal behavior. Researchers in behavioral economics and psychology have tried understand these irrational behaviors and clarified many of the ways humans are likely to be biased. Yet, we are still exploring ways to help people overcome their behavioral biases. This dissertation explores behavioral biases in three different contexts: technology, human cooperation, and banking. This dissertation demonstrates a behavioral bias in A/B testing in technology and quantifies the amount to which this bias is a problem. Second, this dissertation proposes a light institutional intervention of giving more information to study the impacts on trust. Third, this dissertation explores the effects of offering a new financial product to overcome behavioral biases around opening bank accounts and savings. Overall, these papers demonstrate behavioral biases can lead to suboptimal outcomes such as making the wrong business decision or missing out on the benefits of cooperation, or failure to open a bank account and save. Luckily, there are some ways we can overcome biases (Chapter 3), but not all interventions work in the ways we would expect (Chapter 2). The first chapter introduces the behavior of 'p-hacking"", where decision makers stop experiments earlier or later than proper statistical validity requires, possibly because they are overly eager to obtain significant results. Such behavior may result in invalid test conclusions and financial losses. We investigate whether online A/B experimenters 'p-hack' by stopping their experiment based on the p-value of the effect. Our data comes from a leading platform and contains 2,101 A/B tests that track the magnitude and significance level of the effect on every day of the experiment. We estimate the causal effect of reaching a particular p-value on stopping behavior by applying a regression discontinuity design to hazard modeling. Experimenters indeed p-hack, especially for positive lift values. Moreover, experimenters p-hack more if the lift is mildly positive rather than strongly positive. A latent class analysis shows that approximately 57% of experimenters p-hack at the 90% confidence threshold. A false discovery rate (FDR) analysis estimates that p-hacking increases false discoveries by 27.5%, while the overall rate of false-discoveries is 38%. This chapter is coauthored with Ron Berman, Leo Pekelis, and Christophe Van den Bulte. In the second chapter, I introduce an information signal and role organization that may engender more trusting behavior. Trust is an essential ingredient for unlocking economic surplus. However, consider the prisoner's dilemma---all parties gain from cooperation, yet each party has an incentive to deviate. How can we organize society to unlock the possible gains from trust in such situations? We've all had experiences that indicate it is possible. Studies have shown prosocial individuals are more trustworthy. We can take advantage of this fact and suggest pairing prosocial individuals with less prosocial individuals who will trust them if their type is known. In this case, it takes information, timing, and only one pro-social individual to unlock the trust surplus. I find information actually decreases overall trust and does not impact . Consequently, too much information might negatively influence cooperation and trust by changing our biases. In the final chapter coauthored with Paul Gertler, Sean Higgins, and Enrique Siera, I explore whether a financial incentive can nudge people into opening a bank account and saving. Despite the benefits of saving in formal financial institutions, take-up of no-fee formal savings accounts is low among the poor. Surprisingly, even after opening a savings… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)","2019","2020-06-05 21:18:51","2020-06-05 21:18:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of California, Berkeley","","English","","Ph.D.","APA PsycInfo®","2162886554; 2018-65230-095","","","Publication Title: Dissertation Abstracts International Section A: Humanities and Social Sciences AAI10821616","","","http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:APA+PsycInfo%C2%AE&atitle=&title=Essays+in+behavioral+economics&issn=&date=2019-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Scott%2C+Ashling+Michelle&isbn=978-0438654143&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2018-65230-095&rft_id=info:doi/","Sustainable Development; Human; US; 2100:General Psychology; Agricultural Workers; change management practices; farmers; improved farm sustainability; Management Methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"ZNT4MSQ3","thesis","2019","Chung, Chia-Fang","Using personal informatics data in collaboration among people with different expertise","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2162886687?accountid=14026","Many people collect and analyze data about themselves to improve their health and wellbeing. With the prevalence of smartphones and wearable sensors, people are able to collect detailed and complex data about their everyday behaviors, such as diet, exercise, and sleep. This everyday behavioral data can support individual health goals, help manage health conditions, and complement traditional medical examinations conducted in clinical visits. However, people often need support to interpret this self-tracked data. For example, many people share their data with health experts, hoping to use this data to support more personalized diagnosis and recommendations as well as to receive emotional support. However, when attempting to use this data in collaborations, people and their health experts often struggle to make sense of the data. My dissertation examines how to support collaborations between individuals and health experts using personal informatics data. My research builds an empirical understanding of individual and collaboration goals around using personal informatics data, current practices of using this data to support collaboration, and challenges and expectations for integrating the use of this data into clinical workflows. These understandings help designers and researchers advance the design of personal informatics systems as well as the theoretical understandings of patient-provider collaboration. Based on my formative work, I propose design and theoretical considerations regarding interactions between individuals and health experts mediated by personal informatics data. System designers and personal informatics researchers need to consider collaborations occurred throughout the personal tracking process. Patient-provider collaboration might influence individual decisions to track and to review, and systems supporting this collaboration need to consider individual and collaborative goals as well as support communication around these goals. Designers and researchers should also attend to individual privacy needs when personal informatics data is shared and used across different healthcare contexts. With these design guidelines in mind, I design and develop Foodprint, a photo-based food diary and visualization system. I also conduct field evaluations to understand the use of lightweight data collection and integration to support collaboration around personal informatics data. Findings from these field deployments indicate that photo-based visualizations allow both participants and health experts to easily understand eating patterns relevant to individual health goals. Participants and health experts can then focus on individual health goals and questions, exchange knowledge to support individualized diagnoses and recommendations, and develop actionable and feasible plans to accommodate individual routines. Additionally, my dissertation examines ways of incorporating personal informatics data in the clinic. Many clinics have begun to encourage patients to self-collect data that is traditionally collected by medical professionals, with the expectation of increasing clinic efficiency and promoting patient awareness. One example is the proliferation of self-service blood pressure kiosks. In a longitudinal, mixed-method study, I partnered with medical researchers to examine the adoption of self-service blood pressure kiosks in a family medicine clinic. Because of initial concerns raised by patients, staff, and clinicians, the clinic iteratively identified and addressed emerging challenges, provided timely solutions, and improved the overall workflow integration. My dissertation research contributes empirical understanding, design guidelines, theoretical recommendations, and artifacts in human computer interaction, computer-supported collaborative work, and health informatics communities.

Inheritance of this genetic disorder leads to changes in hemoglobin causing the stiffening and distorting of red blood cells into the shape of ""sickles"". As a result, patients experience both chronic and acute pain caused by this sickling that restricts blood flow to different parts of their bodies. The experience of sickle cell pain has been found to be extremely variable within and across patients with respect to location, frequency, severity, age and co-morbidities; each patient is truly unique when it comes to the presentation of pain, making it difficult to define a consistent pain management procedure. Current developments in mobile technology provide new tools for understanding and managing SCD pain outside the clinical setting, where characteristics of pain can be captured using self-report measures administered using mobile applications on patients' smart phones. Mobile sensor technology also allows for the continuous monitoring of physiological measures including heart rate variability, arousal, temperature, and movement. The current project aimed to assess patterns of changes in these physiological measures across different pain intensities, in order to identify if these measures can serve as indicators of pain intensity or the onset of severe pain events in patients with SCD. Four young-adult patients with SCD were recruited from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). The sample included two males, two females, all 20 yrs. old and African Americans. Patients wore the Empatica E4 wristband for four consecutive days which tracked their movement, blood volume pulse (BPV), heart rate (HR), electrodermal activity (EDA), movement, and skin temperature (ST). They also used the Catch My Pain mobile application to track their pain location, pain intensity, pain descriptors, happiness, stress and fatigue. Regression and machine learning analyses were employed to test the hypothesis that the physiological measures captured by the Empatica could predict changes in the patients' reported levels of pain intensity across different periods of the day. Linear regression analyses revealed different combinations of significant predictors for each individual patient; these included the average and standard deviation of heart rate, the average maxline and recurrence of skin temperature, average maxline of skin conductance, and average value of blood volume pulse. For the machine learning, three different classification algorithms Linear Regression, Multi-layer Perceptron and Random Forrest significantly predicted pain severity in two of the four patients. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates the potential to detect pain severity through the examination of patterns of changes in physiological signals including heart rate and skin conductance. It provides new insights into the nature of pain experience as unique to each individual patient, and reveals significant potential in developing pain management interventions that are mindful and adaptive to the individual needs and experiences of patients with SCD.

Both in popular culture and among researchers, there have been concerns about the effects of social media use on psychological well-being and mental health outcomes. This study included both passive and active longitudinal data collection to assess the links between social interaction variables and mental health variables. Participants were 113 college students who installed a monitoring application on their smartphones, completed daily surveys, and allowed the app to collect relevant passive data over a two-week period. Concurrent hierarchical correlations and regressions suggested that neither the frequency of electronic communication nor social media use were associated with daily mental health variables. However, when individuals reported experiencing positive social interactions, they also reported greater well-being and positive affect and less depressive cognition and negative affect on the same day. Hierarchical cross-lagged regressions revealed that none of the social interaction variables predicted next day mental health variables. However, increased negative affect on a given day predicted lower quality social interactions the next day, and increased well-being predicted higher quality social interactions and use of social media the next day. Finally, rumination (a known correlate of depression), moderated the relationship between perceived quality of social interactions and depressive cognition, such that high ruminators experienced more depressive cognition, even when experiencing positive interactions with others. Taken together, the results suggest that the context of interactions may matter much more than the frequency of electronic communication or social media use. Recommendations for future research in contextualizing social media use on smartphones and additional mental health and well-being factors are discussed.

The MPFI is the first published scale to comprehensively assess the 6 dimensions of psychological flexibility and the 6 dimensions of psychological inflexibility proposed by the Hexaflex model (e.g., Hayes, Strosahl & Wilson, 1999), an organizing theoretical framework that evolved out of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes et al., 1999). Toward that end, the current study used the MPFI and measures of individual functioning to track progress over the course of 8 weeks of ACT treatment in a clinical sample. This online study specifically assessed depressive symptoms, global functioning, and psychological flexibility in 32 clients of ACT therapists drawn from across the United States. The study tracked progress during the course of treatment with two separate assessments spaced approximately 8-weeks apart. Repeated measures ANOVAs within the 20 clients completing the second wave of assessment suggested marginal improvement in depressive symptoms (assessed with the PHQ-9) as well as a significant drop in lack of present moment awareness (i.e., lack of mindfulness) and marginal drops in lack of contact with values and global inflexibility across the 8 weeks of treatment assessed. Subsequent hierarchical regressions were run to examine how residual change in the dimensions of flexibility and inflexibility assessed with the MPFI might help to explain corresponding residual change in individual functioning, thereby testing the specific dimensions of the Hexaflex model as possible mediators. Across the outcomes examined (depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, feelings of competency, feelings of relatedness and connectedness to others), all 6 dimensions of psychological flexibility emerged as potential mediators or mechanisms of change to explain improvement in functioning due to ACT. Although individual dimensions varied in how strongly they helped to explain the various outcomes, change on the dimensions of defusion and self-as-context emerged as particularly robust predictors of change on the outcomes examined. In addition, 4 of the 6 dimensions of inflexibility emerged as potential mechanisms of change for the outcome examined, with change in fusion and inaction emerging as consistently linked to corresponding change in individual functioning. A majority of these mediation effects remained significant or even took on additional significance after controlling for non-specific factors that could also account for treatment gains (e.g., client reports of their working alliance with their therapists, their own motivation for treatment, and their perceptions of therapist insensitivity). These results offer compelling initial evidence of the clinical utility of the MPFI and the value it could potentially add to models of therapeutic change as well as to clinical work with individual clients.

"ZXF37PRE","thesis","2019","Walters, Sheri","Beyond incredible: The paralympic road to Rio - an ethnographic study","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2182325419?accountid=14026","The primary purpose of this ethnographic study was to understand the culture of the U.S. Paralympic Track and Field team from the 2015 World Championships through the 2016 Rio Paralympic Games. Secondary purposes included examination of the influence of sport in the lives of those involved in elite adaptive sport, greater examination of barriers and facilitators to participation for those involved in elite sport, issues related to and relevant to healthcare providers and coaches, and the psychosocial effects of the International Paralympic Committee Classification System within Paralympic track and field. Subjects were observed and select participants interviewed after being identified through purposeful snowball sampling. Observation notes, transcribed semi-structured interviews, social media posts, and media coverage were analyzed using theoretical frameworks to guide analyses. Feminist theory guided the ethnographic data analysis related to sport socialization. Self-determination theory was used to analyze the data relevant to healthcare providers and coaches in two separate phenomenological studies. Morgan's practice community was used to theoretically frame the phenomenological study of classification. Rigor was established through triangulation, member checking, peer debriefing, and maintenance of a clear audit trail. Through data analysis, common themes related to the power of sport included a variety of health benefits, and increased participation in society. Barriers to participation included lack of awareness, cost, comorbidities, classification, and ""doping."" Facilitators included family, sponsorships, others involved in sport, and fun. Negative aspects included injuries, illnesses, and transportation issues. Prominent negative aspects require staff to assist in managing those negative consequences, to educate athletes of the potential risk, and to allow athlete autonomy. Common themes that emerged related to socialization into and via sport included aspects related to shared training environments, traveling experiences, humor, and integration into able-bodied training environments and events. The athletes used sport and humor as a form of resistance against disablism leading to a sense of empowerment. Themes related to the role of healthcare providers included the introduction of patients to sport, athletes' perceptions of their healthcare providers as facilitator or barrier, and the roles of a healthcare provider. Providers could play a variety of roles, including serving as a researcher, coach, classifier, or working with athletes as a team medical provider. Providers reported experiences within the Paralympic movement that were personally and professionally rewarding. Prominent themes related to coaching included coaching philosophy, development, and challenges. Another theme was the influence of working with this population in the coaches' lives. Paralympic coaches appear to have adopted an autonomy-supportive-style of coaching, thus empowering their athletes. Coaches report difficulty finding quality adaptive sport coaching education and resources, relying on peer mentorship as a primary mode of gaining knowledge and experience. Adaptive sport athletes often have difficulty finding a program or coach, prompting discussion of integrating athletes with disabilities into able-bodied training groups. Coaches find rewards and meaning in their athletes and their work experiences with this population. Classification issues involving ambulatory sprinters and wheelchair racers produced themes related to psychosocial and potential ethical issues, leading to suggestions for improvement. Lack of transparency and inconsistencies by Paralympic officials and classifiers led to mistrust of the classification system.

This study utilized a qualitative approach and an interpretive phenomenological design to answer the research questions. Semi-structured interviews were used to obtain in-depth data about the three participant's lived experience of winning an Olympic medal at the 2012 Olympic games in London. These interviews were transcribed and significant statements were coded. The codes were then clustered to form subordinate and ultimately master level themes. The master level themes that emerged from the lived experience of all participants in the study were 1) Support, 2) Psychological Factors and 3) Motivation.. Interpretive phenomenological analysis was used to compare the resultant themes of this study to the theoretical framework. This inductive process resulted in consistencies between the results of this study that and the pre-existing theoretical framework, thus supporting and strengthening self-determination and its sub-theory of organismic integration theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985). The results of this study are useful for athletes, coaches, sport leaders and anyone that is interested in performing their best leading up to and during their performance.

A new measure was developed to test for this, the Religion Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (Religion-RSQ) with a sample of 107 online participants. Armed with this new measure, the current study investigated how and if Religion-RS could negatively affect mentoring relationships, and if Attachment security, a variable that has been linked with successful college adjustment and mentoring, could act as a buffer. A sample of 85 Muslim Stony Brook University students were given the Attachment Script Assessment (ASA), Religion-RSQ, Personal- Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (Personal-RSQ), Academic Related Experiences Survey, and a number of mentoring measures (Attitudes towards Mentoring, Mentors in your life Pre-College and College years). The results indicated that Attachment security and Religion-RS affect different planes, with attachment relating to mentoring engagement behaviors and Religion-RS relating to mentoring expectations and attitudes. Religion-RS affects the first step to starting a mentoring relationship, positive attitudes toward mentoring, and therefore, attachment security is not able to act as a buffer within that first step. There were gender differences in average Religion-RS scores, with females, especially females who wear the headscarf/hijab, reporting higher scores- a finding that would be worthy of future examination. Regression analyses indicated that although both Religion-RS and Personal-RS impact on positive attitudes toward mentoring, they also contribute unique as well as shared variance in predicting mentoring attitudes. Results also indicated that number of high school mentor-like experiences positively correlate with number of pre-college mentors, and further that the number of pre-college mentors positively correlate with number of college mentors, thereby suggesting that the predisposition and the skills that might be needed for establishing mentoring relationships begin in high school. In light of the importance of adolescence in identify formation, short-term developmental studies that track both Religion-RS in Muslim students and their mentoring experiences from high school into college should be pursued.

Although previous studies have investigated the use of wearable technology in sport to track several such factors, peer-reviewed research specific to WHOOP technology is limited at best. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of WHOOP technology on sleep, recovery, and batting performance in healthy NAIA baseball players. Data was collected over the course of 4 weeks of in-season play on 10 varsity NAIA baseball players (20.40 +/- 0.97 years). All games -- 18 total -- were played in the afternoon or evening, with 8 occurrences of a doubleheader and 2 occurrences of single games. Internal load parameters (sleep and recovery) were assessed in the experimental group only (5 players) which wore the WHOOP technology. The control group (5 players) did not wear the WHOOP technology. External load parameters (batting performance statistics of OPS and wOBA) were assessed in all 10 players. Individual game day values of time in bed and recovery (both recorded upon waking up), and OPS (recorded at the end of each game day) were examined in the experimental group via Spearman's correlation coefficient. In order to examine control and experimental group differences and changes over time in batting performance, four one-week averages of OPS and wOBA were analyzed via Mann-Whitney U and Friedman's ANOVA tests, respectively. Further, at the conclusion of the study, the experimental group completed an 8-question survey offering insight into lessons learned from learning to use WHOOP technology. No significant results were reported following data analysis. All participants reported trust in the technology and found it to be of benefit in learning about sleep and recovery, and the possible effects of each on batting performance. Continued research on wearable technology and the impact on optimization of athletic performance is warranted at the NAIA level of collegiate athletics.

It has been hypothesized that responsiveness is used to signal emotional information, and many empirical studies have demonstrated that violating expectations about responsiveness is associated with negative evaluations. The increasing use of mobile devices for messaging complicates our understanding of how people decide when to respond to a message. While early work focused on desktop computers and the workplace, the rise of mobile messaging means people can be reached anywhere, at any time, and likely from many different types of contacts they communicate with using their device. As a result, the decision of responding immediately or delaying response is affected by many previously unconsidered factors. To understand how much these different factors affect mobile responsiveness, 92 Android phone owners from around the United States were recruited to participate in this project. Both log data and questionnaire data were collected using a custom built Android app that participants ran on their phones for 7 days. 1,635 session initiation SMS messages were analyzed using a series of multilevel regression models. Results indicate that a user's subjective rating of their availability at the time a message was received is strongly associated with responsiveness. Message attributes, such as how important a message is to the person who received it, have modest effects on responsiveness. Certain types of messages were also associated with much longer delays in responsiveness. Relational variables, such as how close the message recipient is to the message sender, were not found to have large effects on responsiveness.

In this study, middle school youth role-played as scientists recruited by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to stop the Raven Virus from reaching global pandemic. Over 10,000 turns-of-talk were collected and analyzed across the games camp. A combination of discourse analysis surrounding scientific argumentation (Berland & Reiser, 2011) and observational data were used to track shifts in group behavior across the five-day period. Three middle school groups (N=12) composed of participants with and without disabilities are documented within this study. Results identify youth as referencing past performance of assessment-based practices in formal academic environments to measure potential success within the camp. However, student-driven inquiry and activities surrounding gameplay afforded participants an opportunity to co-construct a community language based upon learning experiences. In the end, students with and without disabilities took ownership of each other's educational outcomes through multiple means of expression and representation in gameplay. Future research on collaborative learning and scientific discourse within the context of informal learning environments should be studied further.

Yet, there have been few direct investigations of such interventions. This study tested the effectiveness of a social network–driven, groupbased walking intervention in a medically underserved community. Methods: This study used a quasi-experimental pretest– posttest design with 3 measurement time points to examine the effectiveness of  Sumter County on the Move! in communities in Sumter County, SC. A total of 293 individuals participated in 59 walking groups formed from existing social networks. Participants were 86% females, 67% black, and 31% white, with a mean age of 49.5 years. Measures included perceptions of the walking groups; psychosocial factors such as self-regulation, self-efficacy, and social support; and both self-reported and objectively measured physical activity. Results: The intervention produced significant increases in goal setting and social support for physical activity from multiple sources, and these intervention effects were sustained through the final measurement point 6 months after completion of the intervention. Nonetheless, few of the desired changes in physical activity were observed. Conclusion: Our mixed results underscore the importance of future research to better understand the dose and duration of intervention implementation required to effect and sustain behavior change.

"RR9834TM","thesis","2019","Burghart, Mark","Predicting length of care following concussion","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2269454346?accountid=14026","Concussions have become a prominent injury treated across medical care settings. Due to a complicated underlying pathophysiological process, concussions are subtle and produce a wide array of signs, including cognitive, somatic, and sensorimotor symptoms. The diverse symptomatology makes clinical assessment and management of concussions challenging for clinicians. Additionally, this complexity makes determining recovery trajectory after injury difficult for practitioners. Identifying individuals at risk for long durations of treatment early in their care would allow for early restorative interventions, reduced cost of care, and improved patient quality of life. This need lead to a series of studies attempting to add evidence to support the clinical assessment process of individuals following both suspected and diagnosed concussions. Our first study evaluated the rates and reasons for under-reporting of concussions and symptoms in female high school athletes, a neglected population of study in concussion research. We found female athletes often failed to report concussion symptoms to coaches and trainers. Additionally, only 2/3rds of athletes reported receiving concussion education that may explain the lack of reporting. Different clinical assessment techniques were also explored. Balance and reaction time assessment are commonly completed to help identify individuals with suspected concussion, but these assessments are subjective and often require equipment not available outside of clinical settings. We evaluated the validity and reliability of a mobile device application to assess balance and reaction time as part of a concussion screening. We found Sway (TM) to be comparable to force platform balance assessments and computerized reaction time measurement in healthy subjects, indicating these assessments have clinical utility. Additionally, the assessment only required a mobile device, allowing for assessment in clinics and sports settings without computers or force platform equipment. The last assessment method we evaluated involved neuroimaging techniques. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used in the assessment of individuals with moderate to severe brain injury to objectively track recovery of function after trauma. We explored the similar use of DTI to objectively track recovery of function after concussion. We assessed 10 female participants experiencing slowed recovery of function after a concussion. We found no significant associations between DTI metrics for white matter pathway integrity and changes in symptoms over time, indicating that symptom improvement may occur in a non-congruent fashion with underlying neurological functioning. We did find improvements in pathway integrity were associated with improved reaction time and visual processing, adding to the clinical importance of assessing these skills. A lack of understanding as to which objective clinical features leads to increased risk of prolonged care adds to the complexity of determining a person's recovery trajectory following concussion. This gap in evidence lead to an exploratory study evaluating differences in clinical presentation patterns between groups of individuals with typical treatment durations (&le; 28 days) and extended lengths of care (> 28 days). The exploratory factor analysis yielded different factor structures for each group. Notable differences included age, sex, history of psychiatric disorders, and neurocognitive abilities at the evaluation. These findings suggest clinical differences between individuals with longer and shorter lengths of care are observable at evaluation. After detecting differences between these groups, we sought to clarify the impact of each variable on length of care.

Recently, Xu (2017) derived sufficient conditions for identifying model parameters of a restricted latent class model, which generalizes many existing CDMs. We propose a Bayesian estimation algorithm for this restricted latent class model. The model is applied to the Examination for the Certificate of Proficiency in English language assessment data (e.g., Henson et al., 2007). Chapter 2: There has been a growing interest in measuring students' growth over time. CDMs were traditionally used to measure students' skill mastery at a static time point, but recently, they have been used in many longitudinal models to track students' changes in skill acquisition over time. In this chapter, we propose a longitudinal learning model, where different kinds of skill hierarchies were considered, and the reduced-reparameterized unified model (r-RUM) or the noisty input, deterministic-""and""-gate (NIDA) model is used to measure students' skill mastery at each time point. This model is fitted to the Spatial Rotation data set (e.g., Wang et al., 2016), and different models were compared using Bayesian model comparison methods. Chapter 3: The increased popularity of computer-based testing has enabled researchers to collect various types of process data, including response times. Extensive research has been conducted on the joint modeling of response accuracy and response times. Recent research on CDMs begins to explore the relationship between speed and accuracy to understand students' fluency of applying the mastered skills, in addition to mastery information, in a learning environment. In this chapter, we propose a mixture hidden Markov Diagnostic Classification Model framework for learning with response times and response accuracy. Such a model accounts for the heterogeneities in learning styles among students by modeling the different learning and response behaviors among subgroups. The proposed model is evaluated through a simulation study in terms of parameter recovery. Chapter 4: We introduce an R package, hmcdm, that can be used to fit several longitudinal models for learning under the cognitive diagnosis framework. The package allows users to simulate item responses (and response times if applicable) under several learning models, to fit the models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, to compute point estimates of parameters based on the MCMC samples, and to evaluate and compare different models using Deviance Information Criterion and posterior predictive probabilities.

"ZPLZ852J","thesis","2019","Xiu, Ying","Students' motivation, perspectives, and learning in flipped university classrooms","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2279939494?accountid=14026","The flipped classroom, introduced by Jonathan Bergmann and Aaron Sams in 2008, has been a popular instructional strategy that promotes active learning. In a flipped classroom, the learning content is provided to students before class, and class time is dedicated to engaging students in student-centered activities that reinforce and integrate the knowledge. This dissertation aims to explore the relationship between motivation and students' perspectives, learning performance, and use of online course materials in flipped classrooms. Fifty-nine undergraduate students enrolled in flipped classes completed a survey soliciting their motivation, as defined by the Expectancy-Value theory, and their perceptions of the flipped course. Students' expectancy beliefs (control beliefs about learning, self-efficacy) and value beliefs (task value, intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation) were measured by subscales adopted from Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). Students' final grade percentage represented their learning performance. Brightspace log data were obtained to evaluate students' use of online materials. Results indicated that motivation had an effect on students learning in flipped classroom environments. Students have similar motivation patterns regarding their learning performance in flipped classrooms as in traditional or online classrooms. Regression analyses indicated self-efficacy is a significant predictor of both students' academic achievement and perceptions of the flipped classroom. Overall, students had positive attitudes towards the flipped model but indicated neutral attitudes when asked if they wished more instructors used the flipped classroom model. This study adds to the literature for understanding students' motivation in flipped educational settings and suggests implications foreffective teaching in a flipped classroom. Although the flipped classroom may change the teacher's role from ""sage on the stage"" to a ""guide on the side,"" (King, 1993) the teacher's role in the learning environment remains vitally important.

Specifically, wearable activity trackers have advanced from being simple gyroscopic-pedometers to wrist-worn mobile computers equipped to track various physiological metrics (i.e., heart rate, steps, sleep quality). Researchers in the field of psychophysiology have found evidence that such physiological metrics are significantly related to psychological wellbeing and illnesses such as depression. Given these advances it has become possible to utilize wearable technology to supplement commonly used, albeit slightly flawed, self-report methods of tracking psychological wellbeing. This proof-of-concept pilot study, examined correlations between physiological data collected by a wearable fitness tracker (i.e., heart rate variability, step counts, and sleep quality), with an established self-report assessment of psychological wellbeing, the Psychological General Wellbeing Index. Although many of the findings were nonsignificant, moderately significant relationships were found between objectively collected biobehavioral data and self-reported psychological wellbeing. These findings represent an early step in the process of establishing the viability of using wearable technology within the field of psychology.

"N4V8ATVX","thesis","2019","Lester, Adam Ward","Developing a system to investigate age-related differences in the real-time utilization of dynamically changing external cues during navigation","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2307189053?accountid=14026","Successful navigation depends critically upon two broad categories of sensory information, environmental (allothetic) and self-motion (idiothetic). Both the hippocampus and the medial portion of the entorhinal cortex (MEC) are critical for spatial navigation and contain functionally distinct sub-networks of spatially-modulated cells. These cells are characterized by their tuning to different spatial sensory-perceptual features of the environment and all utilize both allothetic and idiothetic cues to anchor and update their spatial firing to generate a comprehensive and dynamic representation of space. As with older adults, aged rats show pronounced impairments on a number of different spatial navigation tasks and these impairments are accompanied by a bias toward relying on egocentric over allocentric navigation strategies. Similarly, the hippocampus and MEC are also highly susceptible to age-associated changes. The influence visual allothetic cues exert on hippocampal place cell spatial tuning is diminished and delayed in aged animals. Two plausible and non-exclusive explanations that could account for these age-related alterations in allothetic processing are 1) circuit disruptions caused by known age-related functional and anatomical changes in the entorhinal-hippocampal processing pathway or 2) degraded sensory-perceptual information resulting from well-established age-related deficits across multiple sensory domains. Either of these possibilities could have the effect of either slowing allothetic cue processing or weakening the ability of these cues to influence firing field alignment. Within this context, this thesis was conceived with the aim of investigating the degree and timing with which young and aged animals utilize allothetic and idiothetic feedback to update their internal representation of space and calibrate their behavioral output. A large focus of this thesis is given to the incremental design and piloting of a number of novel technologies. Foremost among the methodological contributions of this study is the development of an augmented reality behavioral apparatus, termed the Instantaneous Cue Rotation (ICR) arena, which utilizes projected visual cues to allow for rapid remote control of all symmetry breaking visual features in the environment as rats actively engage in a visual-cue based goal navigation task. The results of extensive behavioral piloting of old and young rats validate both the ICR rotation manipulation as well as the mobile reward delivery system. This system traverses the track in tandem with the rat, enabling food based spatial reinforcement while preventing food-related olfactory cues from becoming associated with any specific location. In parallel with this work, microdrive technology was developed to enable simultaneous recording from both MEC and CA1 which is discussed along with results from single-region hippocampal and MEC implanted rats assessed in the context of a cue rotation manipulation conceptually similar to the that of the ICR. Finally, the results of the behavioral study suggest that in young rats the cue rotation exerts reliable but incomplete control over running behavior. In aged rats, by comparison, the cues exert an overall less pronounced influence on running behavior, consistent with known age-related deficits in allothetic processing. When assessed on a lap-by-lap basis, it was found that the behavior of both young and aged rats became progressively more aligned with the cues over the first few laps following cue rotation. These findings suggest a progressive realignment of behavior from an egocentric to an allocentric reference frame which is reminiscent of the reported progressive realignment of place field firing in response to conflicting spatial feedback.

"WENFUDP3","thesis","2019","Aronson, Brian","Networks of competition: The foundation of market structure and competitive constraint in organizational ecosystems","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2313757401?accountid=14026","Research in organizational ecology demonstrates that an organization's competitive position within its market is highly associated with its survival chances, and that patterns of competitive constraint among organizations influence how markets evolve. However, the literature's conceptualization of market structure is relatively coarse and static; it does not explore how individual organizations' competitive positions shift or how market offerings change over relatively short intervals of time. In this study, I use social network analysis to study the structure of organizations' competitive relationships directly. I examine both how changes in the structure of an organization's competitive environment influence its survival chances, and how the structure of organizations' competitive relationships affect the stability of market offerings. With a combination of a large crowd-sourced restaurant dataset from Yelp.com and census tract information from the American Community Survey (Census Bureau, 2009; Yelp, 2019), I apply methods from social network analysis, text analysis, and geographic information systems to track how restaurants' competitive relationships change over time and space, and to study how these changes influence restaurants' survival chances and overall market stability. This study provides evidence for new mechanisms of competitive constraint among organizations (niche centrality and niche compression) and new mechanisms of market stability (niche redundancy), offers a new theoretic framework for studying market structure and organizational evolution, and has critical implications for theory in the field of organizational ecology.

"P7CMX938","thesis","2019","Corcoran, Taylor Courtney","Drug deals: Policies to increase the availability of effective medications","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2345622013?accountid=14026","Two key issues faced by any policy maker in healthcare are providing effective treatments for ailments and ensuring that these treatments are available to patients. In this dissertation, we use contract theory, epidemic modeling, and queueing theory to study the effectiveness and availability of treatment in the context of medicines and vaccines. In the first essay, ""Flexible FDA Approval Policies"", we analyze the problem faced by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of deciding whether to approve or reject novel drugs based on evidence of their safety and efficacy. Traditionally, the FDA requires clinical trial evidence that is statistically significant at the 2.5% level, but the agency often uses regulatory discretion when making approval decisions. Factors including disease severity, prevalence, and availability of existing therapies are qualitatively considered, but transparent, quantitative guidelines that systematically assess these characteristics are lacking. We develop a novel queueing model of the drug approval process which explicitly incorporates these factors, as well as obsolescence, or when newer drugs replace older formulas. We show that the optimal significance level is higher for diseases with lengthy clinical trials, greater attrition rates in the development stage, low intensity of research and development, or low levels of obsolescence among drugs on the market. Using publicly available data, we estimate model parameters and calculate the optimal significance levels for drugs targeting three diseases: breast cancer, HIV, and hypertension. Our results indicate that the current 2.5% significance level is too stringent for some diseases yet too lenient for others. A counterfactual analysis of the FDA's Fast Track program demonstrates that, by bringing drugs to patients more quickly, this program achieves a level of societal benefit that cannot be attained by solely changing approval standards. The second essay, ""Contracts to Increase the Effectiveness and Availability of Vaccines"", studies contractual issues between global health organizations (GHOs) and pharmaceutical companies in the vaccine supply chain for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). NTDs are a diverse group of conditions that affect over 1 billion individuals worldwide but which have historically received inadequate funding. Current funding mechanisms, such as the Advanced Market Commitment, do not incentivize pharmaceutical companies to exert costly research and development (R&D) effort to develop highly efficacious vaccines. We develop a joint game-theoretic and epidemic model that allows us to study different payment contracts and their impact on the spread of the disease. We show that traditional wholesale price contracts perform poorly and at best mitigat diminish the number of cases the spread of the disease, while performance-based contracts that directly link payment to vaccine efficacy have the potential to eliminate reduce the number of cases to zero the disease. We formulate epidemic models for two NTDs: Chagas, a vector-borne disease most commonly found in Central and South America, and Ebola. We estimate model parameters and conduct a numerical analysis in which we explore the performance of each contract under a variety of cost scenarios. Our results indicate that, when the cost of treating the disease with no vaccine is sufficiently high, performance-based contracts have the potential to facilitate disease eradication, but when treatment costs are low, alternate disease containment methods such as vector control or mass drug administration may be more cost-effective.

"XYHXUUYR","book","2019","","Data analytics and psychometrics: Informing assessment practices","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2405339252?accountid=14026","The general theme of  Data Analytics and Psychometrics: Informing Assessment Practices is to encourage the use of relevant methodology in data mining which is or could be applied to the interplay of education, statistics and computer science to solve psychometric issues and challenges in the new generation of assessments. In addition to item response data, other data collected in the process of assessment and learning will be utilized to help solve psychometric challenges and facilitate learning and other educational applications. Process data include those collected or available for collection during the process of assessment and instructional phase such as responding sequence data, log files, the use of help features, the content of web searches, etc. Some book chapters present the general exploration of process data in large-scale assessment. Further, other chapters also address how to integrate psychometrics and learning analytics in assessment and survey, how to use data mining techniques for security and cheating detection, how to use more assessment results to facilitate student's learning and guide teacher's instructional efforts. Data Analytics and Psychometrics includes both theoretical and methodological presentations that might guide the future in this area, as well as illustrations of efforts to implement big data analytics that might be instructive to those in the field of learning and psychometrics.

It is hoped that readers can learn from different disciplines, especially those who are specialized in assessment, would be critical to expand the ideas of what we can do with data analytics for informing assessment practices.

Is this also the case in cyberspace, where illegal websites and online networks can be wiped clean, but also quickly rebuilt and replaced on new servers and URLs? Methods: I address this question in three steps. First, I measure MDMA trade in a large digital market for drugs, before and after the arrest of a leading MDMA seller in the same market. Second, I count the number of available digital drug markets and vendor shops in the period February 2014–June 2018, to see if websites closed by police were replaced by new ones. Third, I track the digital movement and trading activities of individual drug sellers, before and after law enforcement shut down two large markets. Results: After police arrested a leading MDMA seller, other MDMA sellers filled most—but not all—of the gap. A major law enforcement crackdown reduced the number of available markets, but new ones were created, and market counts eventually surpassed the previous peak. When law enforcement shut down two big markets, many of the sellers relocated to other e-commerce sites and continued high-earning operations there. Conclusion: Arrests and market closures redirect digital drug trade to other sellers and markets. Hot spot policing in cyberspace might produce temporary results, but is arguably ineffective in the long run, as actors use information and communication technology’s unique capacities to reorganize.

Relatively few studies have examined programming for CT in informal online communities, especially for large scale quantitative research. With the repurposing and appropriation of code becoming standard practice for youth programmers in new and networked communities, this study proposes a model to investigate and explain how such remixing practices influence CT in learners. In particular, we use social cognitive theory to transform log data from more than 100,000 students and 200,000 programs in the Scratch online community into cognitive, environmental and behavioral factors. Then path modeling was used to show how the community environment can affect learners’ remixing and further impact CT skills. The results demonstrate the intertwined relationships among the factors, generally showing that remixing can lead to CT improvement, but that over exposure to the community and excessive remixing can actually hinder CT development. Results and implications are further discussed.

Background: Renal nurses play a vital role in caring for patients undergoing dialysis. Despite the high prevalence of medication nonadherence in chronic dialysis patients, little is known about renal nurses’ perceptions and current adherence assessment practices. Design: A cross‐sectional survey. Methods: Participants completed an online survey between March–May 2016. Five psychometric scales were used to measure perception on prevalence and contributors of nonadherence, effective methods of assessment, barriers to assessment and confidence to assess adherence. The survey also captured current adherence assessment practices using a 4‐point graded response (1 = do not practice at all to 4 = practice for every patient). Results: A total of 113 dialysis nurses completed the survey. The majority agreed that patients in their unit are nonadherent to their medicines (74.5%, n = 82; median = 8). Most nurses agreed that having dedicated professionals conducting medication history interviews can be effective in identifying nonadherence (88.9%, n = 96; median = 8). Objective assessment through blood results was the most frequently used method to determine nonadherence (83.2%, n = 89), with little attention being paid to patients’ self‐reports of adherence (55.1%, n = 59). Time constraints, administrative support and patients’ disinterest in discussing medication‐related issues with the nurses were perceived as barriers to assessing adherence. Conclusions: Patient self‐reported measures to assess adherence were underutilised by the renal nurses, whereas objective blood monitoring was routinely used. Overcoming dialysis nurses’ work‐related barriers may facilitate the effective monitoring and promotion of medication adherence in chronic dialysis patients. Relevance to clinical practice: Results from this study emphasise the need for proper assessment of dialysis patient's medication‐taking behaviour during routine dialysis to ensure the benefits of prescribed therapies.

In an immersive virtual city, participants learned the locations of five buildings in the presence of two proximal towers and four distal scenes. Then participants drove two streets without viewing these buildings, towers, or scenes. When they finished driving, either one tower with displacement to the testing position or the scenes that had been rotated reappeared. Participants pointed in the directions of the five buildings. The least squares fitting method was used to calculate participants’ estimated positions and headings. The results showed that when the displaced proximal tower reappeared, participants used this tower to determine their positions, but used self-motion cues to determine their headings. When the rotated distal scenes reappeared, participants used these scenes to determine their headings. If they were instructed to continuously keep track of the origin of the path while driving, their position estimates followed self-motion cues, whereas if they were not given instructions, their position estimates were undetermined. These findings suggest that when people drive in a large-scale environment, relying on self-motion cues, path integration calculates headings continuously but calculates positions only when they are required; relying on the displaced proximal landmark or the rotated distal scenes, piloting selectively resets the position or heading representations produced by path integration.

It is not well understood how people consult the internet for health information after the onset of unfamiliar symptoms and before receiving a potential diagnosis and how online information-seeking can help people appraise their symptoms. This lack of evidence may be partly due to methodological limitations in capturing in real time the online information-seeking process. Objective: We explored women’s symptom attribution and online health information-seeking in response to a hypothetical and unfamiliar breast change suggestive of cancer (nipple rash). We also aimed to establish the feasibility of capturing in real time the online information-seeking process with a tool designed to track participant online searches and visited websites, the Vizzata browser tracker. Methods: An online survey was completed by 56 cancer-free women (mean age 60.34 [SD 7.73] years) responding to a scenario asking them to imagine noticing a red scaly rash on the nipple. Participants were asked to make symptom attributions when presented with the scenario (T1) and again after seeking information online (T2). The online tracking tool, embedded in the survey, was used to capture in real time participant search terms and accessed websites. Results: The tracking tool captured the search terms and accessed websites of most of the participants (46/56, 82%). For the rest (10/56, 18%), there was evidence of engagement in online information-seeking (eg, medical terminology and cancer attribution at T2) despite their searching activity not being recorded. A total of 25 participants considered cancer as a potential cause for the nipple rash at T1, yet only one of these used cancer as a search term. Most participants (40/46, 87%) used rash-related search terms, particularly nipple rash and rash on nipple. The majority (41/46, 89%) accessed websites containing breast cancer information, with the National Health Service webpage “Paget disease of the nipple” being the most visited one. At T2, after engaging in the internet search task, more participants attributed the nipple rash to breast cancer than at T1 (37/46, 66% vs 25/46, 45%), although a small number of participants (6/46) changed from making a cancer attribution at T1 to a noncancer one at T2. Conclusions: Making a cancer attribution for an unfamiliar breast change did not necessarily translate into cancer-termed searches. Equally, not all internet searches led to a cancer attribution. The findings suggest that online information-seeking may not necessarily help women who experience unfamiliar breast cancer symptoms understand their condition. Despite some technical issues, this study showed that it is feasible to use an online browser tracking tool to capture in real time information-seeking about unfamiliar symptoms.

Objective: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of a parent-focused, internet-based healthy lifestyle program for preschool-aged children, who are overweight or at or above the fiftieth percentile for body mass index (BMI) for their age and sex, on child BMI, obesity-related behaviors, parent modeling, and parent self-efficacy. Methods: The Time2bHealthy randomized controlled trial was conducted in Australia, during 2016 to 2017. Participants were recruited both online and through more traditional means within the community. Parent or carer, and child (aged 2-5 years) dyads were randomized into an intervention or comparison group. Intervention participants received an 11-week internet-based healthy lifestyle program, underpinned by social cognitive theory, followed by fortnightly emails for 3 months thereafter. Intervention participants set goals and received individual feedback from a dietitian. They were also encouraged to access and contribute to a closed Facebook group to communicate with other participants and the dietitian. Comparison participants received email communication only. Objectively measured child BMI was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included objectively measured physical activity, parent-measured and objectively measured sleep habits, and parent-reported dietary intake, screen time, child feeding, parent modeling, and parent self-efficacy. All data were collected at face-to-face appointments at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months by blinded data collectors. Randomization was conducted using a computerized random number generator post baseline data collection. Results: A total of 86 dyads were recruited, with 42 randomized to the intervention group and 44 to the comparison group. Moreover, 78 dyads attended the 3- and 6-month follow-ups, with 7 lost to follow-up and 1 withdrawing. Mean child age was 3.46 years and 91% (78/86) were in the healthy weight range. Overall, 69% (29/42) of participants completed at least 5 of the 6 modules. Intention-to-treat analyses found no significant outcomes for change in BMI between groups. Compared with children in the comparison group, those in the intervention group showed a reduced frequency of discretionary food intake (estimate −1.36, 95% CI −2.27 to −0.45;  P = .004), and parents showed improvement in child feeding pressure to eat practices (−0.30, 95% CI 0.06 to −0.00; P = .048) and nutrition self-efficacy (0.43, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.76; P = .01). No significant time by group interaction was found for other outcomes. Conclusions: The trial demonstrated that a parent-focused eHealth childhood obesity prevention program can provide support to improve dietary-related practices and self-efficacy but was not successful in reducing BMI. The target sample size was not achieved, which would have affected statistical power.

Based on this assumption, the present study investigates whether daily mobility flows of the urban population help predict where individual thieves commit crimes.Methods: Geocoded tracks of mobile phones are used to estimate the intensity of population mobility between pairs of 1616 communities in a large city in China. Using data on 3436 police-recorded thefts from the person, we apply discrete choice models to assess whether mobility flows help explain where offenders go to perpetrate crime.Results: Accounting for the presence of crime generators and distance to the offender’s home location, we find that the stronger a community is connected by population flows to where the offender lives, the larger its probability of being targeted.Conclusions: The mobility flow measure is a useful addition to the estimated effects of distance and crime generators. It predicts the locations of thefts much better than the presence of crime generators does. However, it does not replace the role of distance, suggesting that offenders are more spatially restricted than others, or that even within their activity spaces they prefer to offend near their homes.

Firms often use sentiment analysis to identify relevant eWOM that requires a response to consequently engage in webcare. In this paper, we show that sentiment analysis of any kind might not be ideal for this purpose, because it relies on the questionable assumption that only negative eWOM is response-worthy and it is not able to infer meaning from text. We propose and test an approach based on supervised machine learning that first decides whether eWOM is relevant for the brand to respond, and thenâ€”based on a categorization of seven different types of eWOM (e.g., question, complaint)â€”classifies three customer satisfaction dimensions. Using a dataset of approximately 60,000 Facebook comments and 11,000 tweets about 16 different brands in eight different industries, we test and compare the efficacy of various sentiment analysis, dictionary-based and machine learning techniques to detect relevant eWOM. In doing so, this study identifies response-worthy eWOM based on the content instead of its expressed sentiment. The results indicate that these machine learning techniques achieve considerably higher accuracy in detecting relevant eWOM on social media compared to any kind of sentiment analysis. Moreover, it is shown that industry-specific classifiers can further improve this process and that algorithms are applicable across different social networks.

It is also leading tourism companies to have to adapt their marketing strategies to different online social media. The present study analyzes advertising effectiveness in social media in terms of customers' visual attention and self-reported memory (recall). Data were collected through a within-subjects and between-groups design based on eye-tracking technology, followed by a self-administered questionnaire. Participants were instructed to visit three Travel 2.0 websites (T2W), including a hotel's blog, social network profile (Facebook), and virtual community profile (Tripadvisor). Overall, the results revealed greater advertising effectiveness in the case of the hotel social network; and visual attention measures based on eye-tracking data differed from measures of self-reported recall. Visual attention to the ad banner was paid at a low level of awareness, which explains why the associations with the ad did not activate its subsequent recall. The paper offers a pioneering attempt in the application of eye-tracking technology, and examines the possible impact of visual marketing stimuli on user T2W-related behavior. The practical implications identified in this research, along with its limitations and future research opportunities, are of interest both for further theoretical development and practical application.

However, stronger data privacy regulations and the growing privacy consciousness of consumers suggest that much of the data may increasingly only be available to retailers in an anonymized and fragmented form that does not identify individual consumers exactly. In response to the relative paucity of research on marketing analytics in retailing using anonymized and fragmented event-based (AFE) tracking data, this paper makes three interrelated contributions. First, we describe the relevance of AFE data in the future of retailing, contrasting it with other forms of aggregate and individual-level data. Second, we propose a methodology for analyzing AFE data, which allows us to approximately recover individual-level heterogeneity and derive meaningful variables from the raw data. Third, we validate the methodology using representative data collected by deploying sensor-enabled shelves in a field experiment within a store. We find that our approach to analyzing AFE data can help uncover interesting patterns of consumer behavior and could be applied across other online and offline retail settings in practice.

The game leverages elements of a popular, previously sedentary game—traditional fantasy sports—but incorporates and encourages physical activity (PA) of participants (""fantasy team owners""). Early proof-of-concept stage research demonstrated potential for active fantasy sports to increase PA in adults (Moller et al., 2014). However, more formative research identifying factors that influence enjoyment of active fantasy sports and PA goal achievement could improve efficacy and inform the development of alternative AVGs. Design: Three active fantasy sports leagues were organized and data from the three leagues were combined to examine intervention and social factors that predicted enjoyment and PA goal achievement. Method: Participants ( N = 33, 15.2% female, M-Age = 34.0 years) wore an accelerometer to track PA and completed self-report measures about their experience upon league conclusion (league duration ranged from 16 to 17 weeks). Results: Findings revealed that average steps significantly increased during the first six weeks of the intervention and then significantly decreased during subsequent weeks. Frequency of checking the league website was associated with greater PA goal achievement. Greater frequency of checking the accelerometer website and the league website were also associated with greater league enjoyment. Conclusions: Promoting greater frequency of using the league and accelerometer websites is important to achieving greater impact on PA and league enjoyment through active fantasy sports. Future studies of active fantasy sports leagues could use randomized controlled trial and multiphase optimization strategy designs to vary game components in order to test which components sustain intrinsic motivation and increase PA. Lessons may be further applied to the development of other AVGs, especially those that build on established and popular sedentary video games.

There was an error in the Funding statement of the original article. The correct number for the National Project is ""AWS14J011."" (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2017-27809-001). Trust and trustworthiness contribute to reciprocal behavior and social relationship development. To make better decisions, people need to evaluate others’ trustworthiness. They often assess this kind of reputation by learning through repeated social interactions. The present event-related potential (ERP) study explored the reputation learning process in a repeated trust game where subjects made multi-round decisions of investment to different partners. We found that subjects gradually learned to discriminate trustworthy partners from untrustworthy ones based on how often their partners reciprocated the investment, which was indicated by their own investment decisions. Besides, electrophysiological data showed that the faces of the untrustworthy partners induced larger feedback negativity (FN) amplitude than those of the trustworthy partners, but only in the late phase of the game. The ERP results corresponded with the behavioral pattern and revealed that the learned trustworthiness differentiation was coded by the cue-elicited FN component. Consistent with previous research, our findings suggest that the anterior cue-elicited FN reflects the reputation appraisal and tracks the reputation learning process in social interactions.

As the importance of information and communication technologies (ICT) continues to grow, measures of ICT literacy skills, digital reading, and problem-solving in technology-rich environments (PSTRE) are increasingly important topics for exploration through computer-based assessment (CBA). This study used process data collected in log files and survey data from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), with a focus on the United States sample, to (a) identify employment-related background variables that significantly related to PSTRE skills and problem-solving behaviors, and (b) extract robust sequences of actions by subgroups categorized by significant variables. We conducted this study in two phases. First, we used regression analyses to select background variables that significantly predict the general PSTRE, literacy, and numeracy skills, as well as the response time and correctness in the example item. Second, we identified typical action sequences by different subgroups using the chi-square feature selection model to explore these sequences and differentiate the subgroups. Based on the malleable factors associated with problem-solving skills, the goal of this study is to provide information for improving competences in adult education for targeted groups.

Neurocognitive aging models suggest that the aged memory system is biased toward pattern completion, resulting in a behavioral preference for retrieval over encoding of memories. Here, we built on our previously developed behavioral recognition memory paradigm—the Memory Image Completion (MIC) task—a task to specifically target pattern completion. First, we used the original design with concurrent eye‐tracking in order to rule out perceptual confounds that could interact with recognition performance. Second, we developed parallel versions of the task to accommodate test settings in clinical environments or longitudinal studies. The results show that older adults have a deficit in pattern completion ability with a concurrent bias toward pattern completion. Importantly, eye‐tracking data during encoding could not account for age‐related performance differences. At retrieval, spatial viewing patterns for both age groups were more driven by stimulus identity than by response choice, but compared to young adults, older adults' fixation patterns overlapped more between stimuli that they (wrongly) thought had the same identity. This supports the observation that older adults choose responses perceived as similar to a learned stimulus, indicating a bias toward pattern completion. Additionally, two shorter versions of the task yielded comparable results, and no general learning effects were observed for repeated testing. Together, we present evidence that the MIC is a reliable behavioral task that targets pattern completion, that is easily and repeatedly applicable, and that is made freely available online.

Adopting a car technology acceptance model (CTAM), online surveys were implemented in several Texas cities including 2016 survey of Dallas, Houston, and Waco, which is an extension of a prior 2015 survey study in Austin. Adding different geographic content provided an opportunity to assess trends and to obtain more robust results and different insights on the consumer acceptance and travel behavior impacts of self-driving vehicles. Following an extensive descriptive analyses, a multivariate model was estimated to examine the factors influencing intent to use in Texas cities. The results show an increase in intent to use from 2015 to 2016. Demographic variables mattered but to lesser extent compared to psychosocial variables of the CTAM, which were highly significant in predicting intent to use. Younger individuals, males and individuals with physical conditions that prohibiting them from driving had a higher likelihood of intent to use. Travel behavior characteristics were also important. For example, individuals owning a vehicle with highly automated features had a higher intention to use. The strongest associations with intent to use were observed for attitudes toward self-driving vehicles, performance expectation, perceived safety, and social influence. In moving forward, it will be important to continue to monitor and track the behavior with diverse populations, and build an evidence-based consensus through continuous measurement on intent to use automated vehicles.

Consequently, it is important to understand how frequently this behavior occurs, to track whether it increases throughout a lecture, and to quantify the potential costs to learning. In two studies, we measured rates of disengagement during lectures related to media use (i.e. media multitasking; Studies 1 & 2) and lecture-unrelated thoughts (i.e. mind wandering; Study 2). We also measured the impact of these behaviors on learning using quiz questions at the end of each lecture, and students’ actual course tests. In both Study 1 and 2, we found that rates of media multitasking were relatively high and increased as time elapsed in a lecture, while in Study 2, consistent with prior work, rates of mind wandering remained relatively stable. Interestingly, media multitasking - but not mind wandering - was associated with negative learning outcomes.

Method: Data were from the Childhood Determinants of Adult Health study. Children aged 9 to 15 years in 1985 completed a questionnaire with health motivation items. In 2004–2006, when aged 26 to 36, participants completed assessments of health behaviors (smoking, diet, alcohol consumption, and physical activity) and cardiometabolic outcomes (body mass index, carotid intima-media thickness from ultrasound, and HOMA insulin resistance from fasting blood samples). Structural path regression analyses examined pathways from health motivation in childhood to adult cardiometabolic outcomes, mediated via adult health behaviors measured concurrently, controlling for age, sex and socioeconomic position. Results: There were 6,230 (49% female) children with data on health motivation. There were two latent constructs: health motivation (4 items: visiting a dentist, visiting a doctor, knowing about your body, and eating a good diet) and risk motivation (3 items: not being a smoker, not being fat, and not drinking alcohol). Greater health motivation was directly associated with nonsmoking, lower carotid intima-media thickness, and lower body mass index in adulthood. Greater risk motivation was directly associated with smoking, higher alcohol consumption, and poorer diets in adulthood. It was also indirectly associated with higher carotid intima-media thickness and higher HOMA insulin resistance via poorer health behaviors. Conclusions: Health motivation during childhood appears important to maintain health across the life course. It could be a target for interventions to improve cardiovascular health in children and adults.

Compared to a poor diet, a reported “excellent” diet was associated with sleep tracking ( p < 0.05). Interestingly, compared to individuals who never smoke, report of smoking “everyday” was associated with sleep tracking ( p < 0.05). Finally, individuals who reported current use of their mobile device for other health functions (e.g., chat with their doctor or log symptoms) were more likely to report sleep tracking on their mobile device ( p < 0.05).

Especially in the case of data on people’s happiness, two projects have received substantial attention from both the media and the scientific world: “Track your happiness” from Killingsworth and Gilbert (Science, 330, 932-932, 2010), and “Mappiness,” from MacKerron (2012). Both happiness apps used the experience sampling method to ask people a few times per day how they feel, what they do, with whom, and where. The collected data are then displayed for the participants in simple graphs to help them understand what makes them happy and what does not. Both studies have collected considerable data without giving participants any financial rewards. But quantity is not everything that matters with respect to data collection, and thus, understanding whether nationally representative datasets can be collected using such happiness apps is crucial. To address this question, we built a new happiness app and ran a case-study with over 4000 participants of the innovation sample of the German Socio-Economic Panel (Richter and Schupp in Schmollers Jahrbuch, 135(3), 389–399, 2015). Participants were informed that the app collects data on everyday happiness after a household interview and asked whether they would like to use the app. In the first year (2015), participants did not receive any reward, and in the second year (2016), a different group of participants received a 50 Euro Amazon voucher for their participation. The results showed that our happiness app cannot generate nationally representative datasets if it is not controlled that all demographic sub-groups have access to a smartphone, are highly motivated with a sufficient reward and data is collected with quota sampling.

Two distinct educational settings were included: colleges, where the majority of students are below the legal age for drinking, and university, where all students would be legally allowed to drink. A cross-sectional correlational design was adopted. Ninety-four college (16–18 years) and 138 university students (18–28 years) from the UK completed an online survey, of whom 54.7% and 86.9% reported pre-partying at least once per month, respectively. Alcohol use was measured using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test – Consumption (AUDIT-C) and pre-partying motivations were assessed using the Pre-partying Motivations Inventory (PMI). Frequency of pre-partying behavior and the number of units consumed was also recorded. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that, for college students, AUDIT-C positively predicted pre-partying frequency, while gender and AUDIT-C positively predicted the units of alcohol consumed but Barriers to Consumption (BC) negatively predicted units consumed. Among university students AUDIT-C and Interpersonal Enhancement predicted pre-partying frequency, and AUDIT-C predicted the amount of pre-partying units consumed. Different motives for pre-partying motives were identified across two distinct educational settings. The finding that BC negatively correlated with the amount of alcohol consumed amongst younger college students requires further study, as it contradicts previous work in this area, but is consistent with findings that availability predicts alcohol intake. Understanding differences in drinking behavior between age groups is a key finding, which will allow future research to track developmental influences on the effectiveness of interventions.

This empirical study aims to assess the interaction between human and iHeart. In line with this, a survey was conducted among healthcare professional in two cities of Isfahan and Penang to find how intention to “Use” of iHeart and “User satisfaction” conveys the role of effective factors [Information Quality (IQ), Service Quality (SQ), System Quality (SysQ), Trust (Tr), Anxiety (Ax), and mHealth Literacy (mHL)] to the “Success of Human Interaction (SHI)” with iHeart. The total number of 323 respondents returned the questionnaire. Using DeLone and McLean IS success model, a conceptual model was developed to identify the mediating effects of “Use” and “User satisfaction”. Covariance-based structural equation modelling was applied for data analysis using the statistical software AMOS. In this study, mediation effect was examined in three different methods including Baron and Kenny, Sobel test, and Bootstrapping technique. The most reliable results are from bootstrapping technique, which indicate that “Use” mediates the effects of SysQ, Tr, and mHL on SHI. In addition, “User satisfaction” is a mediator between SysQ, SQ, and mHL with SHI. Ultimately, IQ has direct effect on SHI without involvement of mediator.

However, not all BI children develop anxiety. Attention bias (AB) may enhance the vulnerability for anxiety in BI children, and interfere with their development of effective emotion regulation. In order to fully probe attention patterns, we used traditional measures of reaction time (RT), stationary eye-tracking, and recently emerging mobile eye-tracking measures of attention in a sample of 5- to 7-year-olds characterized as BI (N = 23) or non-BI (N = 58) using parent reports. There were no BI-related differences in RT or stationary eye-tracking indices of AB in a dot-probe task. However, findings in a subsample from whom eye-tracking data were collected during a live social interaction indicated that BI children (N = 12) directed fewer gaze shifts to the stranger than non-BI children (N = 25). Moreover, the frequency of gazes toward the stranger was positively associated with stationary AB only in BI, but not in non-BI, children. Hence, BI was characterized by a consistent pattern of attention across stationary and ambulatory measures. We demonstrate the utility of mobile eye-tracking as an effective tool to extend the assessment of attention and regulation to social interactive contexts.

Efforts to eradicate ongoing and prevent future misconduct are numerous and varied, yet the question of “what works” remains largely unanswered. To shed light on this issue, this study used data from both mail and online surveys administered to a stratified random sample of tenured and tenure-track faculty members (N = 613) in the social, natural, and applied sciences at America’s top 100 research universities. Participants were asked to gauge the effectiveness of various intervention strategies: formal sanctions (professional and legal), informal sanctions (peers), prevention efforts (ethics and professional training), and reducing the pressures associated with working in research-intensive units. Results indicated that (1) formal sanctions received the highest level of support, (2) female scholars and researchers working in the applied sciences favored formal sanctions, and (3) a nontrivial portion of the sample supported an integrated approach that combined elements of different strategies. A key takeaway for university administrators is that a multifaceted approach to dealing with the problem of research misconduct, which prominently features enhanced formal sanctions, will be met with the support of university faculty.

As NPSs may vary with illness severity, knowledge of how people with dementia and their caregivers describe and rate the importance of agitation symptoms can improve the understanding of the clinical meaningfulness of the manifestations of agitation. The internet provides new opportunities to better understand patient experiences, as patients and caregivers increasingly look to Web-based platforms as a means of managing symptoms. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine Web-based reports from a dementia symptom website to better understand the symptoms of agitation and explore how they are being targeted for monitoring by caregivers of people with dementia. Methods: The Dementia Guide website hosts a Web-based database used by caregivers (97%) and people with dementia (3%). From its 61 dementia symptoms, users can select relevant symptoms that they deem important to monitor or track the effects of treatment. We employed a staging algorithm to determine if individuals had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild, moderate, or severe dementia. Agitation was defined using terms consistent with the International Psychogeriatrics Association’s provisional consensus definition. We compared the proportion of people with NPSs and agitation across stages of dementia severity and studied how many agitation-defining descriptors were selected, and how often they occurred, by stage. Results: As of March 2017, 4121 people had used the tracking tool, of whom 2577 provided sufficient data to allow disease severity staging. NPSs were tracked by 2127/2577 (82.54%) and agitation by 1898/2577 (73.65%). The proportion in whom agitation was tracked increased with increasing cognitive impairment: 68.5% (491/717) in people with MCI, and 72.50% (754/1040), 73.3% (378/516), and 90.5% (275/304) in mild, moderate, and severe dementia, respectively (χ² ₃ = 54.9;  P < .001). The number of NPS and agitation descriptors selected also increased with severity (median number of NPSs = 1, 2, 2, and 3 for MCI, mild, moderate, and severe dementia, respectively, Kruskal-Wallis H Test H3 = 250.47; P < .001; median number of agitation descriptors = 1, 2, 3, and 4, H3=146.11; P < .001). Conclusions: NPSs and agitation are common targets for tracking over the course of dementia and appear more frequently with increasing disease severity. These common and distressing symptoms represent clinically meaningful targets in treating people with dementia.

In a pre‐clinical model, rats exhibit negative affect to a normally rewarding tastant when it predicts impending, but delayed cocaine, and nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons dynamically track this state. Here, we examined the effects of short versus prolonged experimenter‐imposed cocaine abstinence on negative affect, cocaine seeking and self‐administration. Rats were given 14 saccharin‐cocaine sessions; NAc activity and affective responses to the taste (i.e. taste reactivity) were measured during sessions 1 and 14. Next, following 1 or 30 days of abstinence, taste reactivity and cell firing were recorded in a three‐phase test session: (1) intraoral saccharin infusions, (2) extinction and (3) cocaine self‐administration. Results showed that 30 days of abstinence led to a significant enhancement of aversive responses to the cocaine‐paired tastant, accompanied by a dramatic decline in NAc phasic activity during tastant infusion. While extinction behavior did not differ across groups, NAc phasic firing reemerged during drug seeking. Further, when drug was again readily available, greater aversion to the drug‐paired tastant before and after abstinence was associated with increased self‐administration following prolonged (30‐day) abstinence in rats classified as high (not low) aversive. Collectively, these findings show that drug‐induced dysphoria is enhanced following prolonged cocaine abstinence and that NAc neural signaling is dynamic, dampening when negative affect is at its highest (phase 1), but transitioning back ‘online’ during subsequent drug seeking and taking (phases 2 and 3).

In the article, the authors found that the following references better supported their research and have updated Table 1. See erratum for full description. The online version of this article has been corrected.] Objective: In response to The White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault’s recommendations, the Administrator-Researcher Campus Climate Collaborative (ARC3) has curated an empirically sound, no-cost campus climate survey for U.S. institutions of higher education. The ARC3 survey contains 19 modules that assess a range of Title IX violations, including sexual harassment, dating violence, and sexual misconduct victimization and perpetration; sexual misconduct prevention efforts, resources, and responses; and key predictors and possible outcomes of sexual misconduct. This article describes the ARC3 survey development and pilot test psychometric data. Method: A total of 909 students attending one of three U.S. universities responded to the survey; 85% of students who began the survey completed it. Students completed the ARC3 survey in slightly less than 30 min, on average. Results: The majority of measures produced evidence for at least acceptable internal consistency levels (α > .70), with only two short item sets having marginal reliability (α = .65–.70). Correlations among scales matched expectations set by the research literature. Students generally did not find the survey distressing; in fact, students viewed the climate assessment as important and personally meaningful. Conclusion: The survey performed sufficiently well in pilot testing to recommend its use with U.S. college populations.

The gaze-contingent window paradigm was used to compare the extent of the perceptual span in reading of scrolling and static sentences. Across two experiments, this investigation confirmed that the allocation of attentional resources to the right of fixation was compressed with scrolling text. There was no evidence for a reversal of the direction of asymmetry or a confounding shift of landing position. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract) Impact statementPublic Significance Statement: Horizontally scrolling text is commonly used in digital media in situations where extended passages of text need to be displayed in a limited space; for example, for rolling news tickers. Reading scrolling text requires the additional task of tracking the words as they move across the screen, making this a challenging reading situation, but little is known about its impact on text processing and comprehension. Here we report two experiments showing that one important change that readers make to cope with the additional tracking requirement is a reduction in the amount of attention allocated to process upcoming text. This may have implications for understanding the processing adjustments that need to be made when reading in different kinds of challenging reading situations, as well as for the application of this specific text presentation format.

In this special issue of  Computers in Human Behavior, we report six studies conducted by interdisciplinary teams’ use of various trace methodologies such as eye tracking, log-files, physiological data, facial expressions of emotions, screen recordings, concurrent think-alouds, and linguistic analyses of discourse. The research studies focus on how these data were analyzed using a combination of traditional statistical techniques as well as educational data-mining procedures to detect, measure, and infer cognitive, metacognitive, and social processes related to regulating the self and others across several tasks, domains, ages, and contexts. The results of these studies point to future work necessitating interdisciplinary researchers’ collaboration to use theoretically based and empirically derived approaches to collecting, measuring, and modeling multimodal multichannel SRL data to extend our current models, frameworks, and theories by making them more predictive by elucidating the nature, complexity, and temporality of underlying processes. Lastly, analyses of multimodal multichannel SRL process data can significantly augment advanced learning technologies by providing real-time, intelligent, adaptive, individualized scaffolding and feedback to address learners’ self-regulatory needs.

In the present study, we employed a new, four-quadrant choice preference task that allowed zebrafish to swim freely between a live shoal and a motorized mobile shoal, a live shoal and playback of a video-recorded shoal, or a motorized mobile shoal and playback of a video-recorded shoal. Behavior tracking software was used to track subjects’ movements in upper and lower quadrants on either side of the test arena. Subjects spent more time near the live shoal, especially in the lower quadrant, and exhibited different swim patterns in response to each simulated conspecific alternative, suggesting that zebrafish prefer a live shoal over models of lower fidelity.

Subjects were also interested in ePRO features, such as knowing estimated PRO completion time at the outset, tracking their progress in real time as they complete a questionnaire, seeing the data that they report in order to track their health status, being encouraged to complete their diary if they fall behind by positive messaging, and being thanked for their completion of a daily diary.Conclusions: Investigators should consider including these preferences when designing ePRO assessments. Incorporating patient preferences for ePRO design can ultimately help reduce patient burden and increase engagement, compliance, and improve data quality.

Early mobilization is a postoperative ERAS module that can be self-managed by patients, but poor adherence is common. Visualization is increasingly being used to improve patient understanding and adherence to health behaviors. This study tested whether an animated visualization intervention could improve adherence to postoperative mobilization. Method: Ninety six colorectal and gynecological oncology surgery patients were randomized to intervention, active control, or standard care groups. Intervention participants saw an animated intervention on a computer tablet at Day 1 postsurgery. All participants wore fitness trackers from day of discharge to 7 days postdischarge, and completed psychological measures at baseline, Day 1 postsurgery, and 7 days postdischarge. Results: Step count data was available for 57 colorectal surgery participants. A main effect of group demonstrated that intervention participants had a significantly higher average daily step count from discharge across the week following discharge (M adj = 2,294.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1,746.11, 2,744.89]) compared with control participants (M adj = 1,347.25, 95% CI [826.51, 1,871.20]; p = .05). At postsurgery, intervention participants reported significantly greater perceived quality of recovery and less difficulty in being mobile compared with control participants. There were no between-group differences in self-reported exercise or perceptions of surgery and recovery. Conclusion: This brief intervention appears effective in improving perceptions of early mobilization, and initial evidence suggests improvements in adherence to postsurgical mobilization. This intervention has high clinical applicability and could be incorporated into postoperative standard care.

The dynamics of mind-wandering remain elusive because it is difficult to track when someone’s mind is wandering based only on behavior. The goal of this study is to develop a machine-learning classifier that can determine someone’s mind-wandering state online using electroencephalography (EEG) in a way that generalizes across tasks. In particular, we trained machine-learning models on EEG markers to classify the participants’ current state as either mind-wandering or on-task. To be able to examine the task generality of the classifier, two different paradigms were adopted in this study: a sustained attention to response task (SART) and a visual search task. In both tasks, probe questions asking for a self-report of the thoughts at that moment were inserted at random moments, and participants’ responses to the probes were used to create labels for the classifier. The 6 trials preceding an off-task response were labeled as mind-wandering, whereas the 6 trials predicting an on-task response were labeled as on-task. The EEG markers used as features for the classifier included single-trial P1, N1, and P3, the power and coherence in the theta (4–8 Hz) and alpha (8.5–12 Hz) bands at PO7, Pz, PO8, and Fz. We used a support vector machine as the training algorithm to learn the connection between EEG markers and the current mind-wandering state. We were able to distinguish between on-task and off-task thinking with an accuracy ranging from 0.50 to 0.85. Moreover, the classifiers were task-general: The average accuracy in across-task prediction was 60%, which was above chance level. Among all the extracted EEG markers, alpha power was most predictive of mind-wandering.

Methods: For the analyses we used cross-sectional baseline data from 310,652 participants in the UK Biobank study. We investigated interaction effects of GPRS-obesity with objectively measured and self-reported PA, cardiorespiratory fitness, commuting mode, walking pace, TV viewing, playing computer games, PC-screen time and total sedentary behaviour on BMI. Body mass index (BMI) was the main outcome measure. Results: GPRS-obesity was associated with BMI (β:0.54 kg.m −2 per standard deviation (SD) increase in GPRS, [95% CI: 0.53; 0.56]; P = 2.1 × 10 −241). There was a significant interaction between GPRS-obesity and objectively measured PA (P[interaction] = 3.3 × 10 −11): among inactive individuals, BMI was higher by 0.58 kg.m −2 per SD increase in GPRS-obesity ( p = 1.3 × 10 −70) whereas among active individuals the relevant BMI difference was less (β:0.33 kg.m −2, p = 6.4 × 10 −41). We observed similar patterns for fitness (Unfit β:0.72 versus Fit β:0.36 kg.m −2, P [interaction] = 1.4 × 10 −11), walking pace (Slow β:0.91 versus Brisk β:0.38 kg.m −2, P [interaction] = 8.1 × 10 −27), discretionary sedentary behaviour (High β:0.64 versus Low β:0.48 kg.m −2, P [interaction] = 9.1 × 10 −12), TV viewing (High β:0.62 versus Low β:0.47 kg.m −2, P [interaction] = 1.7 × 10 −11), PC-screen time (High β:0.82 versus Low β:0.54 kg.m −2, P [interaction] = 0.0004) and playing computer games (Often β:0.69 versus Low β:0.52 kg.m −2, P [interaction] = 8.9 × 10 −10). No significant interactions were found for commuting mode (car, public transport, active commuters). Conclusions: Physical activity, sedentary behaviours and fitness modify the extent to which a set of the most important known adiposity variants affect BMI. This suggests that the adiposity benefits of high PA and low sedentary behaviour may be particularly important in individuals with high genetic risk for obesity.

This paper aims to investigate the effects of reward-based instruments on promoting emerging mobility schemes and active transport, through real-world demonstrations in two European cities. Specifically, a route planning mobile application which tracks users’ travel patterns was used to integrate a reward program offering points to incentivize people towards sustainable multimodal choices, including public transport, cycling and walking. In addition, a web-based questionnaire survey was conducted, and a discrete choice model was developed to model individuals’ multimodal choice in the presence of different reward types, including monetary rewards, points and the provision of added value services. Overall, our findings indicate that reward-based instruments can contribute to the promotion of sustainable and emerging transport services. In particular, participants spent more time in public transport usage and walking during the reward-based period. Our results indicate that rewards could increase individuals’ time spent in public transport usage and walking by about 21 min and 14 min per day respectively. Furthermore, it is found that public transport users were mostly motivated by rewards, while car users and walkers were not motivated towards cycling. Finally, the results indicate that Birmingham’s users were more motivated than Vienna’s participants, as public transport usage increased by about 209 min per week in Birmingham vs. 74 min per week in Vienna. Similar patterns of increase in the cities were observed for walking, while some population groups in Vienna were found insensitive to the prospect of earning rewards for using sustainable transport modes.

Importance: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging now allows in vivo visualization of both neuropathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD): amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. Observing their progressive accumulation in the brains of clinically normal older adults is critically important to understand the pathophysiologic cascade leading to AD and to inform the choice of outcome measures in prevention trials. Objective: To assess the associations among Aβ, tau, and cognition, measured during different observation periods for 7 years. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective cohort study conducted between 2010 and 2017 at the Harvard Aging Brain Study, Boston, Massachusetts. The study enrolled 279 clinically normal participants. An additional 90 individuals were approached but declined the study or did not meet the inclusion criteria. In this report, we analyzed data from 60 participants who had multiple Aβ and tau PET observations available on October 31, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: A median of 3 Pittsburgh compound B–PET (Aβ, 2010-2017) and 2 flortaucipir-PET (tau, 2013-2017) images were collected. We used initial PET and slope data, assessing the rates of change in Aβ and tau, to measure cognitive changes. Cognition was evaluated annually using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (2010-2017). Annual consensus meetings evaluated progression to mild cognitive impairment. Results: Of the 60 participants, 35 were women (58%) and 25 were men (42%); median age at inclusion was 73 years (range, 65-85 years). Seventeen participants (28%) exhibited an initial high Aβ burden. An antecedent rise in Aβ was associated with subsequent changes in tau (1.07 flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratios [SUVr]/PiB-SUVr; 95% CI, 0.13-3.46; P = .02). Tau changes were associated with cognitive changes (−3.28 z scores/SUVR; 95% CI, −6.67 to −0.91; P = .001), covarying baseline Aβ and tau. Tau changes were greater in the participants who progressed to mild cognitive impairment (n = 6) than in those who did not (n = 11; 0.05 SUVr per year; 95% CI, 0.03-0.07; P = .001). A serial mediation model demonstrated that the association between initial Aβ and final cognition, measured 7 years later, was mediated by successive changes in Aβ and tau. Conclusions and Relevance: We identified sequential changes in normal older adults, from Aβ to tau to cognition, after which the participants with high Aβ with greater tau increase met clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment. These findings highlight the importance of repeated tau-PET observations to track disease progression and the importance of repeated amyloid-PET observations to detect the earliest AD pathologic changes.

Tau changes were associated with cognitive changes (−3.28 z scores/SUVR; 95% CI, −6.67 to −0.91; P = .001), covarying baseline Aβ and tau. Tau changes were greater in the participants who progressed to mild cognitive impairment (n = 6) than in those who did not (n = 11; 0.05 SUVr per year; 95% CI, 0.03-0.07; P = .001). A serial mediation model demonstrated that the association between initial Aβ and final cognition, measured 7 years later, was mediated by successive changes in Aβ and tau. Conclusions and Relevance: We identified sequential changes in normal older adults, from Aβ to tau to cognition, after which the participants with high Aβ with greater tau increase met clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment. These findings highlight the importance of repeated tau-PET observations to track disease progression and the importance of repeated amyloid-PET observations to detect the earliest AD pathologic changes.

Web-based interventions are able to alter health behaviors and show stronger effects when they are informed by a behavior change theory. MyPlan 2.0 is a fully automated electronic health (eHealth) and mobile health (mHealth) intervention targeting physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) based on the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA). Objective: This study aimed to test the short-term effect of MyPlan 2.0 in altering levels of PA and SB and in changing personal determinants of behavior in adults with T2DM and in adults aged ≥50 years. Methods: The study comprised two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with an identical design. RCT 1 was conducted with adults with T2DM. RCT 2 was performed in adults aged ≥50 years. Data were collected via face-to-face assessments. The participants decided either to increase their level of PA or to decrease their level of SB. The participants were randomly allocated with a 2:1 ratio to the intervention group or the waiting-list control group. They were not blinded for their group allocation. The participants in the intervention group were instructed to go through MyPlan 2.0, comprising 5 sessions with an interval of 1 week between each session. The primary outcomes were objectively measured and self-reported PA (ie, light PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA, total PA, number of steps, and domain-specific [eg, transport-related] PA) and SB (ie, sitting time, number of breaks from sitting time, and length of sitting bouts). Secondary outcomes were self-reported behavioral determinants for PA and SB (eg, self-efficacy). Separate linear mixed models were performed to analyze the effects of MyPlan 2.0 in the two samples. Results: In RCT 1 ( n = 54), the PA intervention group showed, in contrast to the control group, a decrease in self-reported time spent sitting ( P = .09) and an increase in accelerometer-measured moderate ( P = .05) and moderate-to-vigorous PA ( P = .049). The SB intervention group displayed an increase in accelerometer-assessed breaks from sedentary time in comparison with the control group ( P = .005). A total of 14 participants of RCT 1 dropped out. In RCT 2 ( n = 63), the PA intervention group showed an increase for self-reported total PA in comparison with the control group ( P = .003). Furthermore, in contrast to the control group, the SB intervention group decreased their self-reported time spent sitting ( P = .08) and increased their accelerometer-assessed moderate ( P = .06) and moderate-to-vigorous PA ( P = .07). A total of 8 participants of RCT 2 dropped out. Conclusions: For both the samples, the HAPA-based eHealth and mHealth intervention, MyPlan 2.0, was able to improve only some of the primary outcomes.

Inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), have been associated with both the malignant transformation of epithelial cells and tumor progression, thus linking low-grade inflammation with a higher risk of cancer and recurrence in the survival phase. Therefore, they are considered valuable prognostic biomarkers. Knowing and finding appropriate primary prevention strategies to modify these parameters is a major challenge in reducing the risk of cancer recurrence and increasing survival. Different therapeutic strategies have shown efficacy in the modification of these and other biological parameters, but with contradictory results. There are apparently no strategies in which telemedicine, and specifically mobile health (mHealth), are used as a means to potentially cause biological changes. Objective: The objectives of this study were to: (1) check whether it is feasible to find changes in inflammation biomarkers through an mHealth strategy app as a delivery mechanism of an intervention to monitor energy balance; and (2) discover potential predictors of change of these markers in breast cancer survivors (BCSs). Methods: A prospective quasi-experimental pre-post study was conducted through an mHealth energy balance monitoring app with 73 BCSs, defined as stage I-IIIA of breast cancer and at least six months from the completion of the adjuvant therapy. Measurements included were biological salivary markers (IL-6 and C-reactive protein [CRP]), self-completed questionnaires (the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30, the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale [uMARS] and an ad hoc clinical and sociodemographic questionnaire) and physical objective measures (accelerometry, weight and height). In addition, using the logging data of the mHealth app, the rate of use (in days) was recorded during the entire experimental phase of the study. Using Stata software, a paired two-tailed t test, Pearson and Spearman correlations, and a stepwise multiple regression analysis were used to interpret the data. Results: Analyzing changes in inflammatory biomarker concentrations after using the mHealth app, differences between preassessment CRP (4899.04 pg/ml; SD 1085.25) and IL-6 (87.15 pg/ml; SD 33.59) and postassessment CRP (4221.24 pg/ml; SD 911.55) and IL-6 (60.53 pg/ml; SD 36.31) showed a significant decrease in both markers, with a mean difference of –635.25 pg/ml (95% CI –935.65 to –334.85;  P < .001) in CRP and –26.61 pg/ml (95% CI –42.51 to –10.71; P = .002) in IL-6. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that changes in global quality of life, as well as uMARS score and hormonal therapy, were possible predictors of change in CRP concentration after using the mHealth app. In the same way, the type of tumor removal surgery conducted, as well as changes in weight and pain score, were possible predictors of change in IL-6 concentration after using the app. Conclusions: In conclusion, through the results of this study, we hypothesize that there is a possible association between an mHealth energy balance monitoring strategy and biological changes in BCSs. These changes could be explained by different biopsychosocial parameters, such as the use of the application itself, quality of life, pain, type of tumor removal surgery, hormonal treatment or obesity.

Additionally, it examined how searching online for information about vaccination influences users’ attitudes toward vaccination. We conducted an experimental study with 56 undergraduate students from a German university that consisted of a survey and eye-tracking while browsing the Internet, followed by a content analysis of the eye-tracking data. The results show that the users exposed themselves to balanced and diverse online information about vaccination. However, none of the examined cognitive factors (attitude toward vaccination, attitude salience, prior knowledge about vaccination, need for cognition, and cognitive involvement) influenced the amount of time users spent searching the Internet for information about vaccination. Our study was not able to document any effects of attitude-consistent selective exposure to online information about vaccination. In addition, we found no effect on attitude change after having searched the Internet for vaccine-related information. Thus, users’ search behavior regarding vaccination seems to be relatively stable.

Computer vision technology can automatically track subtle facial actions to gain quantitative insights into ASD related behavioral abnormalities. Method: This study proposes a novel psychovisual human-study to elicit spontaneous facial expressions in response to a variety of social and emotional contexts. We introduce a markerless facial motion capture and computer vision methods to track spontaneous and subtle activations of facial muscles. The facial muscle activations are encoded into ten representative facial action units (FAU) to gain quantitative, granular, and contextual insights into the psychophysical development of the participating individuals. Statistical tests are performed to identify differential traits in individuals with ASD after comparing those in a cohort of age-matched TDC individuals. Results: The proposed framework has revealed significant difference (p < 0.001) in the activation of ten FAU and contrasting activations of FAU between the group with ASD and the TDC group. Unlike the TDC group, the group with ASD has shown unusual prevalence of mouth frown (FAU 15) and low correlations in temporal activations of several FAU pairs: 6–12, 10–12, and 10–20. The interpretation of different FAU activations suggests quantitative evidence of expression bluntness, lack of expression mimicry, incongruent reaction to negative emotions in the group with ASD. Conclusion: Our generalized framework may be used to quantify psychophysical traits in individuals with ASD and replicate in similar studies that require quantitative measurements of behavioral responses.

Method: We reviewed research characterizing cancer survivors’ and their multiple providers’ common sense cognitive models of survivors’ main health threats, preventable causes of adverse health events, and optimal coping strategies. Results: Findings indicate that no entity in the health care system self-identifies as claiming primary responsibility to address longstanding unhealthy lifestyle behaviors that heighten survivors’ susceptibility to both cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and whose improvement could enhance quality of life. Conclusions: To address this gap, we propose systems-level changes that integrate health promotion into existing survivorship services by including behavioral risk factor vital signs in the electronic medical record, with default proactive referral to a health promotionist (a paraprofessional coach adept with mobile technologies and supervised by a professional expert in health behavior change). By using the patient’s digital tracking data to coach remotely and periodically report progress to providers, the health promotionist closes a gap, creating a connected care system that supports, reinforces, and maintains accountability for healthy lifestyle improvement. No comparable resource solely dedicated to treatment of chronic disease risk behaviors (smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, treatment nonadherence) exists in current models of integrated care. Integrating health promotionists into care delivery channels would remove burden from overtaxed PCPs and instantiate a comprehensive, actionable systems-level schema of health risks and coping strategies needed to have preventive impact with minimal interference to clinical work flow.

One of the most crucial aspects of developing games lies in modeling and predicting individual behavior, the study of computational models of players in games. Although model-based approaches have been considered standard for this purpose, their application is often extremely difficult due to the huge space of actions that can be created by educational games. For this reason, data-driven approaches have shown promise, in part because they are not completely reliant on expert knowledge. This study seeks to systematically review the existing research on the use of data-driven approaches in player modeling of educational games. The primary objectives of this study are to identify, classify, and bring together the relevant approaches. We have carefully surveyed a 10-year sample (2008–2017) of research studies conducted on data-driven approaches in player modeling of educational games, and thereby found 67 significant research works. However, our criteria for inclusion reduced the sample to 21 studies that addressed four primary research questions, and so we analyzed and classified the questions, methods, and findings of these published works, which we evaluated and from which we drew conclusions based on non-statistical methods. We found that there are three primary avenues along which data-driven approaches have been studied in educational games research: first, the objective of data-driven approaches in player modeling of educational games, namely behavior modeling, goal recognition, and procedural content generation; second, approaches employed in such modeling; finally, current challenges of using data-driven approaches in player modeling of educational games, namely game data, temporal forecasting in player models, statistical techniques, algorithmic efficiency, knowledge engineering, problem of generalizability, and data sparsity problem. In conclusion we addressed four critical future challenges in the area, namely, the lack of proper and rich data publicly available to the researchers, the lack of a data-driven method to identify conceptual features from log data, hybrid player modeling approaches, and data mining techniques for individual prediction.

Typical events are taps, scrolling and typing, carried out to interact with apps. As compared to other measures, this directly encapsulates potential problematic physical smartphone behaviour as a signal. The approach contrasts against conventions such as self-reporting or timing activity sessions, and it focusses on active rather than passive smartphone activity. Using this alternative method, we collected all user interface interaction events from a sample of 64 participants over a period of 8 weeks, using a bespoke monitoring app called Tymer. User Smartphone Addiction was seen to significantly correlate with high levels of interaction with Lifestyle apps, particularly for female users. Interactions with Social apps in general were also associated with Smartphone Addiction. In particular, user interactions with Snapchat correlated with Smartphone Addiction, represented across all types of interface interaction. This is significant given the widespread usage of Snapchat by teenagers, and we hypothesise that the app's design provides a particularly strong pathway in support of Smartphone Addiction.

However, despite a growing body of resources that can quantify smartphone use, research within psychology and social science overwhelmingly relies on self-reported assessments. These have yet to convincingly demonstrate an ability to predict objective behavior. Here, and for the first time, we compare a variety of smartphone use and ‘addiction’ scales with objective behaviors derived from Apple's Screen Time application. While correlations between psychometric scales and objective behavior are generally poor, single estimates and measures that attempt to frame technology use as habitual rather than ‘addictive’ correlate more favorably with subsequent behavior. We conclude that existing self-report instruments are unlikely to be sensitive enough to accurately predict basic technology use related behaviors. As a result, conclusions regarding the psychological impact of technology are unreliable when relying solely on these measures to quantify typical usage.

In this study, data analytics was carried out with data generated from a maternal mental health app to address the following question: what is the temporal behaviour of users when completing ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) with EMAs in the form of mental health scales versus EMAs in the form of mood logs? The methodology involved using the Health Interaction Log Data Analytics (HILDA) pipeline to analyse 1461 app users. Clustering was used to characterise archetypical user engagement with the two forms of EMA. Users preferred mood log EMAs, with 6993 mood log completions compared to 2129 scale completions. Users are more willing to log moods at 9am and 12pm and complete mental health scales between 8pm and 10pm. The fewest number of mood logs and scale completions take place on Saturday followed by a Sunday. Whilst ‘happiness’ is the dominant mood during day times, ‘anxiety’ and ‘sadness’ peak during night times. The overall findings are that users prefer completing mood log EMAs and that the temporal behaviour of users engaging with EMAs in the form of mental health scales are distinctly different from how they engage with mood logs.

Researchers from the fields of metacognition and learning, as well as motivation and learning have thus intensively investigated issues related to the self-evaluation of competences. Insights from both lines of research have been used in the serious game project SERENA to inform the selection and design of technical tasks and tutorial feedback strategies. The main goal of the SERENA project was to develop a serious game for adolescent females that fosters their self-evaluation of competence regarding technical tasks. This paper describes how insights from metacognition, motivation and feedback research were integrated to inform the game design. Furthermore, it reports two evaluation studies conducted with 93 students in real school settings. The findings reveal that girls’ self-evaluation of competences assessed in terms of perceived technical competences and self-concept of technical abilities, as well as intrinsic motivation regarding technical tasks can be strengthened with the serious game Serena Supergreen. The log-file analyses indicate that seeking feedback and help within the game is associated with an increase in perceived competences. The challenges encountered within this applied research field are discussed.

We enrolled a number of 123 healthy native German-speaking adults (53 male, mean age: 36.8 ± 18.86) from the Leipzig Study for Mind-Body-Emotion Interactions (LEMON) database, for whom diffusion MRI data, internet addiction test, brief self-control scale (SCS), coping orientations to problems experienced (COPE), and depression scores were available. DMRI connectometry was used to investigate white matter microstructural correlates of the severity of internet addiction identified through IAT, in a group of healty young individuals. A multiple regression model was adopted with age, gender, SCS total score, COPE total score, and BDI-sum as covariates to track white matter fibers in which connectivity was associated with IAT. The connectometry analysis identified a direct correlation between connectivity in the splenium of corpus callosum (CC), parts of bilateral corticospinal tracts (CST), and bilateral arcuate fasciculi (AF) (FDR = 0.0023001), and an inverse correlation of the connectivity in the genu of CC and right fornix (FDR = 0.047138), with the IAT score in healthy adults. We suggest connectivity in the CC and CST as well as fornix and AF to be considered as microstructural biomarkers of predisposition to IA in healthy population.

Method: The current study investigated proximal (week-to-week) predictors of weight loss and regain in 74 adults during a 3-month, Internet-based behavioral weight loss program followed by a 9-month “maintenance” period (during which no additional intervention was provided). Participants were asked to self-weigh daily using scales that transmitted weight via the cellular network and to answer a brief questionnaire each week querying mood, behaviors, and cognitions hypothesized to be associated with weight loss and regain. Results: Longitudinal multilevel models demonstrated that weight loss during initial intervention was proximally predicted by (a) greater frequency of self-monitoring weight and caloric intake, consistency between eating choices and weight loss goals, and importance of “staying on track” with these goals and (b) less negative mood, boredom with weight control efforts, hunger, and temptation to eat foods “not on plan” (ps < .05). Greater weight regain after intervention was also proximally predicted by these factors (with effects in the opposite direction) and additionally by less physical activity, less positive mood, more stress, greater temptation to skip planned physical activity, and higher ratings of the amount of effort required to stay on track (ps < .05). Conclusions: Results confirmed the importance of self-monitoring for weight loss and maintenance and identified other key week-to-week predictors of weight change. Results also supported efforts to develop intervention approaches specifically focused on weight loss maintenance. Future research should investigate whether using identified predictors to tailor intervention content and timing can improve weight outcomes.

Situation-model construction was measured using both process- and product-oriented measures. Eye-tracking data indicated online resource allocation to the different levels of text representation: surface, textbase, and situation model. Literal text questions and inference questions were used as an offline indication of textbase and situation-model processing, respectively. The results showed that a picture presented before reading led to a redistribution of processing resources during reading, evidenced by a shift from textbase to situation-model processing. This attentional shift did not translate into higher comprehension scores.

In addition, the majority of these studies relies on cross-sectional self-report data. Finally, there are no studies investigating the effect of excessive smartphone use related notifications on self-reported PSU and OMSU. The aim of the current study was to fill that gap. The effective sample comprised 73 people (age M = 26.5, SD = 8.5; 82% women) who were randomly assigned into one of three groups: control, active experimental, or passive experimental. All groups filled out a PSU measure at Time 1. Then, active and passive experimental group used a smartphone use tracking application for three weeks. After receiving their data, active experimental group received instructions for setting up their app so that it would prompt notifications based on their personal smartphone use patterns for the next month of smartphone use, while smartphone use tracking for passive experimental group continued without prompting notifications (Time 2).

"ZSXPVKGN","thesis","2020","North, Sarah Ferrese","Understanding students’ self-regulation in asynchronous online learning","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2348250478?accountid=14026","Despite rapid growth in online enrollment within higher education, persistence and completion rates remain lower for online courses than face-to-face courses. This discrepancy between the two modalities indicates a need to better understand students' self-regulated learning (SRL) within online learning environments. Students with higher SRL skills demonstrate higher academic achievement than those who do not, and so it is critical to investigate the topic of SRL because it is so closely tied with achievement online. This study used a sequential, explanatory mixed methods approach to better understand the experience and actions of undergraduate students in an asynchronous online course who possess varying levels of self-regulation. In the quantitative phase, participants completed the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire which gave a self-reported snapshot into students' motivation, self-regulating skills, and learning strategies. Trace log data from the learning management system (LMS) was additionally collected during four weeks of the semester. During an interim phase, three focal participants were selected and a semi-structured interview protocol was developed for the qualitative phase. The qualitative phase consisted of data collected through interviews with each of the focal participants, and observations of the three participants throughout the semester. Results suggest that while students appreciate the flexibility of an online course, flexibility can also lead to challenges. The flexible nature of a course appeared most challenging during online group work, when taking an online class for the first time, or when time management was poor. It was also found that students with higher levels of SRL strategies tend to dedicate specific time and places to work on coursework, and demonstrated a propensity to log in to the course LMS earlier and more frequently during each course week. Conversely, it was found that a student with lower SRL abilities did not dedicate a specific time or place to studying for the course, and tended to miss group discussion deadlines. Finally, it was found that an online instructors' presence, frequent communication, use of video posts and discussions, and outlining weekly expectations were helpful teaching strategies which encouraged students to maintain motivation and SRL within the course.

The pervasiveness of voice interfaces represents an opportunity for children who are still learning to read and write to independently search the Internet by directing questions at conversational agents such as Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and the Google Assistant. However, little research exists on how children's use of these agents and children's conceptual understanding of them. Through a two-week, in-home deployment involving 40 families (children aged 5–8 and their parents), this study offers a description of how early elementary school-aged children ask questions of a conversational agent (the Google Assistant). Through analysis of the usage logs associated with the smart speakers, I report on how often children's questions are transcribed correctly by the technology, how often they receive an answer addressing their question and which questions children choose to ask the conversational agent. Based on log data supplemented by interviews before and after the deployment, I discuss challenges in use and children's perceptions of the technology. Although about 90% of children's questions are transcribed correctly, the system only offers answers that address the questions about half of the time. Most of children's questions are about topics related to culture and science, demonstrating that children choose to use this technology to ask about the world around them. I offer directions for future research and considerations for the design of voice-based conversational agents that aim to support young children's question-asking behavior and subsequent development.

"A56XUEAG","thesis","2020","Yarmosh, Yevheniia Hryhorivna","Essays in industrial organization","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2354313002?accountid=14026","This dissertation consists of two essays in the fields of Industrial Organization and Behavioral Economics. It studies the issue of consumers' biased beliefs that result in misestimation of personal consumption and excessive spending on the products that will never be used in the future. Chapter 1 introduces the issue of overspending in the videogames market. The excessive purchasing exhibits itself in the behavior when consumers purchase games and never open them later. According to the descriptive statistics, around 29% of games in people's game libraries are unopened as of March 18, 2019. This setting is very beneficial for the analysis in question as besides purchasing decisions one can observe consumption patterns as well, which are usually problematic to track. I gather the main dataset from Steam, one of the biggest online gaming platforms. The data contain daily purchasing and consumption statistics as well as daily prices in all supported currencies for the period of 9 months. In this chapter I study economic and behavioral mechanisms that may be causing such conduct. In particular, I perform survival analysis, discuss search costs, study the effects of game heterogeneity, check for the presence of the projection bias, and consider intertemporal substitution of purchases as possible explanations of the puzzle. I show that none of the above mentioned mechanisms are supported by the dataset and arrive to the conclusion that the main reason for the excessive spending is consumers' biased beliefs regarding their future willingness to try new products. Chapter 2 builds on the results of the first chapter. In this part of the thesis I develop a structural model that takes into account people's biased beliefs at the point of purchasing new products. It is a static model with the elements of dynamic behavior where every period consumers decide how many games they want to purchase based on how many games they stopped playing in the previous period and then decide how much time to devote to playing. I discuss functional and distributional assumptions that I impose in order to identify the parameters of the model. Next I simulate the model and run three counterfactuals that could potentially alleviate the ovespending behavior. In particular, I consider debiasing consumers, removing sales, and decreasing variety (i.e. imposing a lower bound on game quality). According to the simulated results, removing sales only slightly decreases overspending. Decreasing variety also reduces excessive spending, but it is the most effective for low userscore thresholds. One has to determine the optimal threshold that minimizes the effect of the bias. Debiasing consumers is the most effective in the reduction of expenditures, and the total effect depends on the initial magnitude of the bias.

"SQKVHITR","thesis","2020","Hamrick, Danny Wayne","How markets shape geographic indicators: A global value chain analysis of Pisco","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2359391292?accountid=14026","This dissertation explores the ways market dynamics shape the construction of geographical indicator (GI) labels and impact the development outcomes for producers operating under such labels. For foods and drinks, GI labels convey specific geographical origins and qualities or reputations linked to the production region and the community of producers. Originating in Europe, advocates of GI labels have promoted them as viable tools for rural development in both the Global North and the Global South. Opponents, however, are skeptical. They see GIs as easily seized by elites and costly in terms of the resources needed to establish GI laws, promote and protect products, and monitor producers. A large body of research has explored how GI institutions shape economic and environmental outcomes for producers, communities, and regions. However, most research focuses on the producing region and fails to accurately capture the impact of other actors—such as importers, distributors, retailers, or consumers—on the success of GIs. Further, much of the existing research on GIs takes the market for granted, ignoring how broader market factors might influence GI outcomes. In this dissertation, I address these gaps by using a global value chain (GVC) approach to the study of pisco, a Latin American brandy protected by two separate GI labels in two nations, Chile and Peru. GVC analysis, a mixed-method social science framework, uses both quantitative and qualitative approaches to study issues of globalization. Specifically, this project draws on trade data, interviews with key stakeholders and firms, and industry and media reports that track the various actors involved in the production, distribution, and consumption of pisco in order to assess how value chain actors distribute economic and non- economic benefits from the GI. Because both Chile and Peru have established GIs for pisco, it is a unique case that allows for a comparison that holds the product itself constant. My analysis reveals that market dynamics influence how actors conceptualize key dimensions of GIs, such as authenticity and quality. In Peru, low local demand and export dependency leads to a narrow version of authentic pisco. In contrast, high domestic demand for pisco in Chile contributes to broader understandings of authenticity. In both cases, as actors move towards premium markets and new producers enter the industry, quality discussions are evolving away from the GI region and now focus on specific pisco brands. Finally, when looking at the export experience of pisco firms in both nations, my analysis shows how broader market dynamics in the alcoholic spirits GVC influence future growth potential, as they seek to integrate into the global market. Collectively, my findings demonstrate that the market matters. I argue that researchers should study and theorize the market, along with institutions, to better understand the potentials and limits of GI-driven development.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-00714-024). Background: The accurate and regular monitoring cognitive performance in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients is critical to develop new prevention and management strategies for cognitive impairment (CI). The Brain on Track (BoT) test is a self-administered web-based tool developed for cognitive screening and monitoring. The objective of this study was to validate the use of the BoT in MS, by assessing its ability to distinguish between MS patients and matched controls, as well as detect CI among MS patients, by analysing its correlation with standard cognitive tests and its reliability and learning effects in repeatable use. Methods: The BoT was applied in 30 patients with MS consecutively selected and 30 age- and education-matched controls, first in a hospital clinic, under supervision, and then 1 week later from home. After these first two trials, MS patients repeated the test from home every 4 weeks for 3 months. A standard neuropsychological battery was also applied to MS patients at baseline. Results: The Cronbach’s alpha was 0.89. Test scores were significantly different between MS patients and controls (Cohen’s d = 0.87; p < 0.01). Among MS patients, scores were significantly lower in those with CI documented in the standard neuropsychological battery than in their cognitively preserved counterparts (Cohen’s d = 2.0; p < 0.001). The BoT scores presented a good correlation with standard neuropsychological tests, particularly for information processing speed. Regarding test–retest reliability, 10/11 subtests presented two-way mixed single intraclass consistency correlation coefficients > 0.70. Conclusion: The BoT showed good neuropsychological parameters in MS patients, endorsing the use of self-administered computerized tests in this setting.

"NAQ6MA7D","thesis","2020","Kortschot, Sean William","Graphical management of attentional state","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2369523899?accountid=14026","Adaptive user interfaces (AUIs) modify their information content, structure, or interactions in response to changes in operating context, called triggers. This dissertation focuses on the operator measurement class of triggers, which initiate interface adaptations based on changes to an operator's physical or mental state. To infer a user's mental state, we used Passive Data Monitoring (PDM), which is a method that examines streams of interaction data for patterns that are characteristic of an attentional state. AUIs can then search for these patterns and adapt an interface accordingly. This dissertation presents three studies that advance the methodology by which attentional states are detected via PDM and responded to via AUIs.The first study describes two experiments, which identified the behavioural correlates of attentional switches and implemented interventions that mitigated the performance decrement incurred from those switches, respectively. Experiment 1.1 revealed that there was a significant interruption in participant interaction both before and after attentional switches. Experiment 1.2 showed that both of these delays could be reduced by implementing an intervention that contextualized a switch. The second study describes one experiment aimed at developing a machine learning classifier that could detect when participants were in an attentional tunnel. A Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory neural network accurately identified states of attentional tunneling significantly above chance level. This experiment also explored the performance tradeoffs stemming from attentional tunnels. The third study describes two experiments aimed at developing machine learning classifiers capable of detecting information overload and using those classifiers as the engine for an AUI that performed online calibration of the degree of concurrent information presentation, respectively. In the first experiment, four classifiers were developed that all performed above chance level. In the second experiment, two of these classifiers drove two separate AUIs that significantly benefited some user groups relative to experimental controls. The experiment revealed significant differences in how user groups responded to AUIs. Overall, this dissertation contributes to our understanding of how attentional states manifest behaviourally. It also formalizes PDM as a method for understanding, detecting, and leveraging these behavioural manifestations for use in AUIs.

This thesis investigated the functional significance and psychometric properties of a new psychophysiological measure that may be important for research on error monitoring: error-related electromyographic activity over the corrugator supercilii muscle (cEMG). In line with open science principles, this thesis makes all data available online, reports its studies and analyses in chronological order, and completely discloses the history and reasoning behind its methodological decisions. Study 1 showed that in a common error monitoring task, cEMG was not correlated with the error-related negativity (ERN), an early neural signal related to negative affect and adaptive processing, but was positively correlated with the error positivity (Pe), a later neural signal that tracks orienting and error awareness. Study 2 investigated the psychometric properties of cEMG and found that 14 error trials were necessary to obtain a stable and reliable signal. Study 3 used a modified error awareness task to directly examine cEMG's relationship to error awareness, the race of stimuli, and the motivation to respond without racial prejudice. It found that (1) the late component of cEMG was sensitive to error awareness but the early component was not, (2) cEMG was unexpectedly not correlated with the Pe, and (3) cEMG was not related to variation in either the race of stimuli or the motivation to respond without prejudice. Together, this thesis shows the potential for cEMG to be used as a reliable measure of error awareness but highlights the complexities of the signal's measurement and the need for more basic studies to evaluate its function and structure. This thesis also illustrates the challenges and importance of applying open science principles in psychological research following the replication crisis.

Behavioral theories like the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) have demonstrated success in PA behavior change, but perceived benefits and barriers are understudied. PA time barriers are shared between healthy and cancer survivor populations, and study of time use in breast cancer survivors using mobile phone technology like the Life in a Day (LiaD) app would support future intervention development. We conducted 3 studies to investigate benefits and barriers to PA in adults and time use among breast cancer survivors to fill these evidence gaps.Study 1 was a secondary analysis of inactive adults (N=63) in a 12-week IVR-supported randomized-controlled PA trial. Exercise Benefits and Barriers Scale (EBBS) data was summarized; associations (Pearson's correlation), within-group differences (paired t-test), and between-group differences (independent t-test) related to benefits and barriers were explored. Open-ended exit interview responses were qualitatively examined. Study 2 tested the acceptability of a 5-day LiaD app trial in breast cancer survivors (N=40), explored between-group differences (independent t-test) in LiaD app satisfaction, and qualitatively examined open-ended survey responses. Study 3 was a secondary analysis of breast cancer survivor (N=97) time use in a 6-month randomized-controlled PA trial. Within-group (paired t-test) and between-group (independent t-test) changes in LiaD-reported time use minutes and intensity were explored. Time use data was compared to total self-report/accelerometer MVPA measures.In study 1, time and physical exertion were leading exercise barriers. Intervention arm barriers significantly decreased relative to control from baseline to week 12; intervention females increased benefits and decreased barriers while men did not. Benefits and barriers were associated with other SCT constructs but not with baseline MVPA. Qualitative themes corroborated quantitative findings. In study 2, LiaD was found to be acceptable for breast cancer survivor time use measurement; age-related problems with remembering to track or edit activities were indicated. Themes corroborated quantitative results and suggested future app improvements. In study 3, intervention sleep/rest time use minutes increased relative to usual care from baseline to month 6; trends were noted for between-group changes in sitting minutes at month 3 and participant-labeled physical activity intensity at month 6.In conclusion, lack of time remains a common barrier among adults, but remote intervention shows promise for targeting barriers in women. Further, mobile phone time use measurement is an acceptable approach for understanding daily living in breast cancer survivors and provides a different perspective of PA behavior compared to measures of total PA. We can better inform future intervention efforts for breast cancer survivors by improving our understanding of time use in this population.

Business owners and marketing managers in the United States mobile phone industry need a faster and cheaper method of tracking preferences. The repeated administration of preference surveys can be expensive and time-intensive. Data related to Internet-based consumer research was found to be an indicator of purchase intentions in other industries. Consumers perform prepurchase research to determine which products will maximize individual utility. The feasibility of using those data to track preferences in the United States mobile phone industry was unknown. The objective of this quantitative correlational study was to examine if a statistically significant relationship existed that could justify practitioner use of search preference indicator data when tracking changes in consumer product preferences. Data that represented trends in Internet search behavior for specific keywords were collected from trends.google.com. Market share data for mobile phones sold in the United States with an Android or iOS mobile operating system were collected from kantarworldpanel.com. Statistical analysis indicated that strong relationships existed between the data sets. The average Spearman rho correlation statistic found for Android-related data was -.64. The average for iOS-related data was .52. All data pairs were statistically significant. The strong negative relationship between Android-related search terms and Android market share was unexpected. The cause of the negative correlation was unclear, but the finding was significant because only positive relationships had been previously reported for similar research. The body of knowledge was increased because this study included techniques to isolate data for prepurchase research intentions. The research also included the use of search preference indicator data to study the United States mobile phone industry, an industry previously not studied using those data.

"NV4VMU95","thesis","2020","Zawawi, Boshra Fuad","Designing and evaluating the effects of a technology-mediated learning environment that integrates formal and informal learning activities to advance students’ knowledge and skills of instructional design: A design-based research study","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2400597839?accountid=14026","The purpose of this design-based (DBR) research study was to generate a comprehensive understanding of the role of informal learning activities in (a) supporting instructional design (ID) students' acquisition of knowledge and skills required by future employers and (b) establishing their professional development (PD) trajectory to prosper in the field. The goals were to develop a technology-mediated learning environment (TMLE) that integrates formal and informal learning activities for ID students as well as generates and refines the design principles informing the TMLE. The research questions that guided this dissertation study investigated the process and degree to which the TMLE advanced ID students' knowledge and skills and supported the establishment of their professional development (PD) trajectory. To achieve the study's goals, a mixed-method case study approach was used to collect and analyze qualitative and quantitative data. Three phases of the Integrative Learning Design Framework (Informed Exploration, Enactment, and Evaluation of Local Impact) were applied to support the execution of rigorous, iterative cycles to design, develop, and refine the TMLE and the underlying design principles. Each of the phases had unique research questions and methods to develop the critical conjectures that lead to the careful and systematic formation of the design principles. The Informed Exploration and Enactment were pre-dissertation phases. They resulted in a comprehensive understanding of the value of informal learning in supporting ID students' advancement of knowledge and skill sets within formal, informal, and workplace learning environments. The two phases also yielded a solid design of the TMLE and preliminary design principles. The local evaluation phase consisted of implementing the TMLE in an ID master's course, in which an online learning community was generated within Google+ for the students (N =13) to share, discuss, and collaborate with peers and experts in the field around PD goals and formal learning. The data revealed that the TMLE supported the students with understanding some formal learning concepts, reflecting on design decisions, and identifying design tools. Networking with experts in the field exposed the students to cutting edge technologies applied in workplaces and skills required in future careers. Many students were able to identify and refine PD goals based on the job market and collaborated with peers and experts to advance their goals. The study also showed the impact of motivational and hindering factors on students' participation in volunteer learning activities. The study resulted in a total of 14 design principles: (1) TMLE should be mediated by a familiar social media platform; (2) TMLE's goals, general guidelines, and technology should be supported by an in-person tutorial and other supportive materials posted within the learning community; (3) the students should have the option to use a preferred tool to track their PD goals or select one from a list of useful tools; (4) TMLE should allow the students maximum levels of content and context flexibility with respect to topic selection, time-frame, number of informal weekly activities, and blended learning; (5) TMLE should avoid time-consuming activities and increase connections with other courses to limit additional tasks; (6) major informal learning activities in TMLE should be scheduled after the due dates of main formal assignments; (7) building the TMLE's discourse and norm should be supported by sharing members' biographies and ID experiences in the learning community and conducting in-person social networking events; (8) supportive scaffolding is interwoven with facilitation actions in TMLE and should be shared by the course instructor, a facilitator, and experts in the learning community.

"TIAFYKU5","thesis","2020","Liu, Yan","Social support, change talk and people’s health: Investigation of social support solicitation, provision, and change talk in digital alcohol use disorders and substance use disorders support groups","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2402541663?accountid=14026","Using secondary analysis of two data sets collected by the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) at University of Wisconsin–Madison, this dissertation is composed of three studies that address different research questions. In the first study, the online discussion forum examined is from a mobile, technology-based relapse prevention system designed for patients with alcohol use disorder called A-CHESS. I applied quantitative content analysis to examine social support solicitation and provision. The results showed emotional support was the most common response to solicitations overall and was disproportionately offered after recipients disclosed positive emotions. Informational support was more likely to follow after recipients disclosed negative emotions or recovery problems or explicitly requested support. Furthermore, recipients expressed more gratitude after receiving emotional support than other support types.In the second study, the online discussion forum examined is from a mobile, technology-based relapse prevention system designed for patients with substance use disorders called Seva. I used quantitative content analysis, three waves of survey data, and system-use log data to examine the benefits accrued from receiving and providing informational and emotional support. The results showed receiving more emotional support associated with reduced illicit drug use at 6 and 12 months, whereas receiving informational support did not affect substance use outcomes. Self-efficacy also moderated the effect of social support expression on risky drinking days.In the final study of this dissertation, I used the same data set from Seva. I used a supervised machine learning approach to identify change talk in messages posted during 12 months. In addition, I assessed the relationship between social support reception and change talk. I further explored the relationship between change talk and substance use. The results showed the supervised machine learning algorithm performed well based on the fit of the classification algorithm. Change talk was negatively associated with risky drinking days at six months. However, there was not a significant association between social support received in the first period of time and change talk in the second period of time.

Within a response-to-intervention (RtI) framework, data collected via assessment are used to measure student proficiency, track progress, and subsequently align instruction with student learning needs. The purpose of this program evaluation was to explore the use of a computer-adaptive testing (CAT) measure, i-Ready Diagnostic, as part of a rural middle school's assessment process, within an RtI model. This program evaluation sought to gather evidence regarding the ability of different i-Ready reading and math measures, administered in the fall, winter, and spring, to predict student performance on end-of-the-year high-stakes tests (NYS ELA and Math exams). In addition, this evaluation examined the variability in student performance on i-Ready measures based on demographic characteristics, including grade, gender, socio-economic status, ethnicity, and educational program. The evaluation was conducted using archival student data from the 2016–2017 school year and analyzed using multivariate statistical methods.Analyses of data revealed that, for this population of students, i-Ready scores demonstrated a strong relationship with NYS exam scores, yet the repeated measures administered in fall, winter, and spring provided little new information about variability in student performance compared to a single measurement. Regarding differences in i-Ready performance across disaggregated subgroups of students, the results suggest significant differences exist across time based on grade, gender, socio-economic status, ethnicity, and educational program. These findings are supported by the literature and provide important information for the school to consider when interpreting assessment results. Given these findings, implications for the associated school are discussed and recommendations for developing and improving assessment practices, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness, are provided. These results are setting specific but may spur future research and evaluation of these assessment measures in the field.

"2QJZH7R3","thesis","2020","Yang, Zhitong","Evidence model: Evaluate complex problem-solving competency from process data","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2406657612?accountid=14026","Computer-based assessments allow practitioners to collect rich process data by logging students' interactions with assessment tasks. In addition to providing final responses to test questions, computer-based assessments promise to furnish more evidence to support claims about what a student knows and can do through logging process data in log files. However, because these rich log file data often contain both useful information and noise, such as unpredictable actions or emerging behaviors, culling useful information is a challenging task. Some data-driven approaches (such as educational data mining) have recently been used to identify patterns in process data, but the identified patterns are often difficult to interpret.There is a crucial need to interpret process data based on cognitive theories to provide valid evidence for claims made in large-scale summative assessments. Evidence-centered design (ECD; Mislevy, Almond, & Lukas, 2004; Mislevy, Almond, Steinberg, & Lukas, 2006), a framework for educational assessment development, advocates that evidence identification and interpretation should be linked to the competencies/skills to be assessed and the design of a task used in an assessment. Guided by the ECD framework, this study employs a theory-driven approach to analyze and interpret rich process data generated from one interactive task used in the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) complex problem-solving assessment.To develop principles that can be used to identify evidence of complex problem-solving competencies/skills, this study examined the interactive task structure and reviewed cognitive theories of complex problem-solving, and based on which, a theory-based coding scheme was proposed. Based on the coding scheme, process data were coded to identify specific behaviors that are relevant to the complex problem-solving. An exploratory factor analysis revealed multi-dimensional cognitive abilities involved in the complex problem-solving. Then, the 2012 PISA complex problem-solving scoring rubric was evaluated in terms of whether there is evidence from process data to support it. Finally, the incremental predictability of student competency/skill evaluations based on behavioral coding is examined. Specifically, the study aimed to answer three research questions: (a) Can student process data generated from one interactive task in the 2012 PISA complex problem-solving assessment reflect distinct cognitive competencies/skills? (b) To what extent can evidence from process data support the ratings of student performance evaluated based on their final responses on the PISA complex problem-solving assessment? (c) To what extent do student groups sorted by a few behavioral indicators show different levels of academic achievement on the 2012 PISA assessments of complex problem-solving, science, mathematics, and reading? The results of the study showed that, based on a theory-based coding scheme, the process data generated from the 2012 PISA complex problem-solving task can be meaningfully interpreted and reflects distinct cognitive competencies/skills. In addition, this study found that process data provides supporting evidence to the 2012 PISA scoring rubric. Furthermore, the study identified behavioral indicators of targeted cognitive competencies/skills that differentiate student performance on complex problem-solving and other academic assessments. The study demonstrates how a theory-driven approach to evaluating student performance through process data could contribute to establishing an evidence model for a complex problem-solving task.

Although subjective well-being predicts better health outcomes, people with chronic conditions tend to report lower well-being. Improving well-being might mitigate costs associated with chronic illness; however, existing interventions can be difficult to access and draw from a single theoretical approach. Happify, a digital well-being intervention program drawing from multiple theoretical traditions to target well-being, has already been established as an efficacious means of improving well-being in both distressed and nondistressed users. Objective: This study aimed to compare change in well-being over time after using Happify for users with and without a chronic condition. Methods: Data were obtained from Happify users, a publicly available digital well-being program accessible via website or mobile phone app. Users work on tracks addressing a specific issue (eg, conquering negative thoughts) composed of games and activities based on positive psychology, cognitive behavioral therapy, and mindfulness principles. The sample included 821 users receiving at least 6 weeks’ exposure to Happify (ranging from 42 to 179 days) who met other inclusion criteria. As part of a baseline questionnaire, respondents reported demographic information (age and gender) and whether they had any of the prespecified chronic conditions: arthritis, diabetes, insomnia, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, psoriasis, eczema, or some other condition (450 reported a chronic condition, whereas 371 did not). Subjective well-being was assessed with the Happify Scale, a 9-item measure of positive emotionality and life satisfaction. To evaluate changes in well-being over time, a mixed effects linear regression model was fit for subjective well-being, controlling for demographics and platform usage. Results: At baseline, users with a chronic condition had significantly lower subjective well-being (mean 38.34, SD 17.40) than users without a chronic condition (mean 43.65, SD 19.13). However, change trajectories for users with or without a chronic condition were not significantly different; both groups experienced equivalent improvements in well-being. We also found an effect for time from baseline ( b = 0.071; SE = 0.010; P < .01) and number of activities completed ( b = 0.03; SE = 0.009; P < .01), and a 2-way interaction between number of activities completed and time from baseline ( b = 0.0002; SE = 0.00006; P < .01), such that completing more activities and doing so over increasingly longer periods produced improved well-being scores. Conclusions: Data from this study support the conclusion that users with a chronic condition experienced significant improvement over time. Despite reporting lower subjective well-being on the whole, their change trajectory while using Happify was equivalent to those without a chronic condition. Consistent with past research, users who completed more activities over a longer period showed the most improvement. In short, the presence of a chronic condition did not prevent users from showing improved well-being when using Happify.

Objective: This study aimed to propose a conceptual data-driven framework that tracks digital markers of public organ donation awareness using Twitter and delivers an optimized social network intervention (SNI) to targeted audiences using Facebook. Methods: We monitored digital markers of organ donation awareness across the United States over a 1-year period using Twitter and examined their association with organ donation registration. We delivered this SNI on Facebook with and without optimized awareness content (ie, educational content with a weblink to an online donor registration website) to low-income Hispanics in Los Angeles over a 1-month period and measured the daily number of impressions (ie, exposure to information) and clicks (ie, engagement) among the target audience. Results: Digital markers of organ donation awareness on Twitter are associated with donation registration (beta = .0032;  P < .001) such that 10 additional organ-related tweets are associated with a 3.20% (33,933/1,060,403) increase in the number of organ donor registrations at the city level. In addition, our SNI on Facebook effectively reached 1 million users, and the use of optimization significantly increased the rate of clicks per impression (beta = .0213; P < .004). Conclusions: Our framework can provide a real-time characterization of organ donation awareness while effectively delivering tailored interventions to minority communities. It can complement past approaches to create large-scale, sustainable interventions that are capable of raising awareness and effectively mitigate disparities in organ donation.

Typical oculomotor assessments measure individual eye movements in a series of restrictive tests designed to isolate features such as response times. These measures lack ecological validity for athletes because athletes are adept at simple tasks designed for the general population. Yet, because eye movement metrics are sensitive and well-characterized neuroanatomically, it would be valuable to test whether athletes exhibit abnormal eye movements with more challenging tasks. To address this gap in knowledge, we collected eye-tracking data during a sport-like task to gain insight on gaze behavior during active self-motion. SPEMs and saccadic eye movements were recorded during a sport-like visual task within 24–48 h following SRC. Thirty-six Division I student-athletes were divided into SRC and control (CON) groups. All participants completed two blocks of the Wii Fit © soccer heading game (WF) while wearing a monocular infrared eye tracker. Eye movement classification systems quantified saccadic amplitude (SA), velocity (SV), and count (SC); as well as SPEM velocity (SPV) and amplitude (SPA). Separate Mann-Whitney U tests evaluated SPA and SC and found no significant effects (SPA, p = 0.11; SC, p = 0.10). A multi-variate analysis of variance (MANOVA) for remaining variables revealed SPV was significantly greater in CON ( p < 0.05), but the SRC group had greater SA and SV ( p < 0.05). These findings suggest that during a sport-like task, to maintain foveation SRC subjects used larger amplitude, faster saccades, but exhibited slower SPEMs. Measuring oculomotor function during ecologically valid, sport-like tasks may serve as a concussion biomarker and provide insights into eye movement control after SRC.

However, there has been little research utilizing this innovative approach with young patients who are in the early phase of schizophrenia. Methods: Outpatients in the early course of schizophrenia (n = 42) were compared to controls (n = 13) at cross-sectional study points. Patients were within 2 years of their first psychotic episode, were an average of 22.2 years old and had an average of 12.3 years of education. We used the Virtual Reality Functional Capacity Assessment Tool (VRFCAT) and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) Performance- Based Skills Assessment-2 (UPSA-2) to assess functional capacity. The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) and the Cognitive Assessment Interview (CAI) were the measures of cognitive functioning. The Global Functioning Scale: Role (GFS-R) and Social (GFS-S), and the Role Functioning Scale (RFS) were the measures of daily functioning. Results: Early course patients vs controls were slower (patient  M = 830.41 seconds vs control M = 716.84 seconds; t = 3.0, P < .01) and committed more errors (patient M = 3.2 vs control M = 1.7 seconds, t = 2.9, P < .01) on the VRFCAT. Total time was significantly correlated with the UPSA ( r = −0.66, P < .01), MCCB ( r = −0.70, P < .01), CAI ( r = −0.51, P < .01), and GFS role ( r = −0.52, P <. 01) and social functioning (r = −0.43, P = .03). Conclusions: We extend previous findings to patients with first-episode schizophrenia. Virtual-reality–based performance was correlated with a standard test of functional capacity, indicating VRFCAT validity. Furthermore, correlations with cognitive functioning and occupational/school and social functioning indicate promise as a coprimary measure to track changes in response to treatment.

Patient-accessible electronic health records (PAEHRs) are available to citizens aged 16 years and older through the national health portal Helsenorge. Objective: This study aimed at understanding how patients use PAEHRs. Three research questions were addressed in order to explore (1) characteristics of users, (2) patients’ use of the service, and (3) patient experience with the service. Methods: We conducted an online survey of users who had accessed their EHR online at least once through the national health portal. Patients from two of the four health regions in Norway were invited to participate. Quantitative data were supplemented by qualitative information. Results: A total of 1037 respondents participated in the survey, most of whom used the PAEHR regularly (305/1037, 29.4%) or when necessary (303/1037, 29.2%). Service utilization was associated with self-reported health, age, gender, education, and health care professional background. Patients found the service useful to look up health information (687/778, 88.3%), keep track of their treatment (684/778, 87.9%), prepare for a hospital appointment (498/778, 64.0%), and share documents with their general practitioner (292/778, 37.5%) or family (194/778, 24.9%). Most users found it easy to access their EHR online (965/1037, 93.1%) and did not encounter technical challenges. The vast majority of respondents (643/755, 85.2%) understood the content, despite over half of them acknowledging some difficulties with medical terms or phrases. The overall satisfaction with the service was very high (700/755, 92.7%). Clinical advantages to the patients included enhanced knowledge of their health condition (565/691, 81.8%), easier control over their health status (685/740, 92.6%), better self-care (571/653, 87.4%), greater empowerment (493/674, 73.1%), easier communication with health care providers (493/618, 79.8%), and increased security (655/730, 89.7%). Patients with complex, long-term or chronic conditions seemed to benefit the most. PAEHRs were described as useful, informative, effective, helpful, easy, practical, and safe. Conclusions: PAEHRs in Norway are becoming a mature service and are perceived as useful by patients. Future studies should include experimental designs focused on specific populations or chronic conditions that are more likely to achieve clinically meaningful benefits. Continuous evaluation programs should be conducted to assess implementation and changes of wide-scale routine services over time.

Therefore, a data analytics approach that does not involve information on the mobility of particular persons was developed, providing economically relevant data on aggregate mobility while protecting personal data. The activity data aggregation was conducted at 15‐min intervals in the area of each cellular base station; “activity” is defined as the number of outgoing and incoming calls and sent and received text messages (short message service or SMS) and, in some instances, as the count of unique users. The case study examines all of Latvia's municipalities, analysing the economic activity level in each municipality in comparison to the mobile phone activity in three periods: 2015–2016, 2017, and 2018. It was concluded that the economic activity in municipalities can be estimated, and positive dynamics of regional development have been detected. Such data and the data analytics method, which provides an understanding of how economic activities evolve in real time in particular locations and economic activity centres, can improve regional development planning and plan implementation. In order to assess which are the centres of economic activity in each municipality and its sphere of influence, the patterns of human commuting and fluctuations of internal activity on workdays and weekends/holidays in 2017–2018 were determined. In general, there is a shortage of reliable data on human commuting within Latvia and its specific regions; therefore, the method described here provides a practical tool for regional governments to keep track of strategy implementation and for strategic gap analysis.

Self-reported questionnaires were distributed in the e-learning system-starC and a total of 287 valid questionnaires were collected, meanwhile system log was collected to record students’ actual behavior online. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that system quality (SQ), social influence (SI) and facilitating conditions (FC) have significant positive effects on behavioral intention (BI) whereas information quality (IQ) has none on BI. There is no significant positive relationship among FC, BI and use behavior (UB), and only moderator effect of gender exists. The results suggested that male college students are more susceptible to the impact of system quality and social influence.

While there are several definitions and frameworks for the measurement of CPS, the relationships between the subskills remain unclear. Understanding these relationships can have a direct impact on how assessments are designed, how the measures are developed, and how teaching interventions are planned. The approach outlined here represents use of an inference model in assessment rather than a model in which direct responses to questions with correct and incorrect responses are used to identify abilities. Inferences about capabilities are made based on student behaviors in an online environment as represented through log files generated during test administration. In this study, identified behaviors are common across student, CPS task and assessment. Through the application of an Item Response Theory model, the behaviors can be evaluated much like items on a traditional test. In comparing the difficulty and ordering of items, differences and similarities for each behavior within and across assessments can be examined. This paper presents findings from data collected from over 3000 students that identifies shifts in patterns of student behaviors. The patterns across students, during testing, and across testing situations for CPS subskills such as negotiation, responsiveness, perseverance and communication are presented and discussed. The extent to which assessment design differences between assessments may lead to differences in how students respond to them are highlighted.

Automatically inferring the states or needs of learners from their posts is of interest to instructors, who are faced with a high attrition in MOOCs. Machine learning has previously been successfully used to identify states such as confusion or posting questions, but no solution has yet been provided so that instructors can track the progress of the learners using a validated framework from education research. In this paper, we develop a model to automatically label a post based on the first phase of the interaction analysis model (IAM). This allows instructors to automatically identify whether students are stating opinions, clarifying details, or engaging in activities such as providing examples to peers. Our model is tested on a Coursera MOOC devoted to Chemistry, for which we are able to correctly categorize the IAM status in 4 out of 5 posts. Our approach thus provides instructors with an intelligent system that generates actionable learning assessment data and can cope with large enrollment. Using the system, instructors can quickly identify and remedy learning issues, thus supporting learners in attaining their intended outcomes.

The present study investigates the hypothesis that extraversion and neuroticism may be linked with social media addiction because of their association with higher online posting activity. Further, we test the additional hypothesis that the level of positive social feedback received online (i.e., number of Likes) could play a role in mediating this effect, i.e., a serial mediation effect. Sample consisted of 1094 Facebook users, 72% females, aged 18–35. Social media activity was assessed collecting Facebook passive data consisting of the number of status updates, and Likes received during the last 12 months. Personality and social media addiction were assessed via self-report measures. Results showed neuroticism had a direct positive association with addictive social media use, while extraversion did not. Further, frequency of status updates mediated of the link between each personality trait and addictive social media use. Received Likes mediated the link between extraversion and addictive social media use, while no effect emerged for neuroticism. Finally, we found support for the hypothesis of a serial mediation effect linking personality, number of status updates, received Likes, and social media addiction. For both extroverts and neurotics, receiving positive feedback because of increased activity was linked to an increase in the risk for social media addiction. These results highlight the existence of different patterns of associations linking these personality traits, online activity, and social media addiction.

A key challenge for this system is to maintain relevant information in the face of task-irrelevant perturbations. Across two experiments, we investigated the impact of task-irrelevant interruptions on neural representations of working memory. We recorded EEG activity in humans while they performed a working memory task. On a subset of trials, we interrupted participants with salient but task-irrelevant objects. To track the impact of these task-irrelevant interruptions on neural representations of working memory, we measured two well-characterized, temporally sensitive EEG markers that reflect active, prioritized working memory representations: the contralateral delay activity and lateralized alpha power (8–12 Hz). After interruption, we found that contralateral delay activity amplitude momentarily sustained but was gone by the end of the trial. Lateralized alpha power was immediately influenced by the interrupters but recovered by the end of the trial. This suggests that dissociable neural processes contribute to the maintenance of working memory information and that brief irrelevant onsets disrupt two distinct online aspects of working memory. In addition, we found that task expectancy modulated the timing and magnitude of how these two neural signals responded to task-irrelevant interruptions, suggesting that the brain’s response to task-irrelevant interruption is shaped by task context.

Objective: This study aimed to apply rapid online surveying to determine knowledge and perceptions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the general public in the United States and the United Kingdom. Methods: An online questionnaire was administered to 3000 adults residing in the United States and 3000 adults residing in the United Kingdom who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online research. Prolific Academic established strata by age (18-27, 28-37, 38-47, 48-57, or ≥ 58 years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (white, black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, mixed, or “other”), as well as all permutations of these strata. The number of participants who could enroll in each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general population. Enrollment into the survey within each stratum was on a first-come, first-served basis. Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2, 2020. Results: A total of 2986 and 2988 adults residing in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively, completed the questionnaire. Of those, 64.4% (1924/2986) of US participants and 51.5% (1540/2988) of UK participants had a tertiary education degree, 67.5% (2015/2986) of US participants had a total household income between US $20,000 and US $99,999, and 74.4% (2223/2988) of UK participants had a total household income between £15,000 and £74,999. US and UK participants’ median estimate for the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was 5.0% (IQR 2.0%-15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR 2.0%-10.0%), respectively. Participants generally had good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of COVID-19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 37.8% (95% CI 36.1%-39.6%) of US participants and 29.7% (95% CI 28.1%-31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a common surgical mask was “highly effective” in protecting them from acquiring COVID-19, and 25.6% (95% CI 24.1%-27.2%) of US participants and 29.6% (95% CI 28.0%-31.3%) of UK participants thought it was prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. Around half (53.8%, 95% CI 52.1%-55.6%) of US participants and 39.1% (95% CI 37.4%-40.9%) of UK participants thought that children were at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: The distribution of participants by total household income and education followed approximately that of the US and UK general population. The findings from this online survey could guide information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media. More broadly, rapid online surveys could be an important tool in tracking the public’s knowledge and misperceptions during rapidly moving infectious disease outbreaks.

Internet interventions for smoking cessation have the potential to significantly impact public health, given their broad reach and proven effectiveness. Given the dose-response association between engagement and behavior change, identifying strategies to promote engagement is a priority across digital health interventions. Text messaging is a proven smoking cessation treatment modality and a powerful strategy to increase intervention engagement in other areas of health, but it has not been tested as an engagement strategy for a digital cessation intervention. Objective: This study examined the impact of 4 experimental text message design factors on adult smokers’ engagement with an internet smoking cessation program. Methods: We conducted a 2×2×2×2 full factorial screening experiment wherein 864 participants were randomized to 1 of 16 experimental conditions after registering with a free internet smoking cessation program and enrolling in its automated text message program. Experimental factors were  personalization (on/off), integration between the web and text message platforms (on/off), dynamic tailoring of intervention content based on user engagement (on/off), and message intensity (tapered vs abrupt drop-off). Primary outcomes were 3-month measures of engagement (ie, page views, time on site, and return visits to the website) as well as use of 6 interactive features of the internet program. All metrics were automatically tracked; there were no missing data. Results: Main effects were detected for integration and dynamic tailoring. Integration significantly increased interactive feature use by participants, whereas dynamic tailoring increased the number of features used and page views. No main effects were found for message intensity or personalization alone, although several synergistic interactions with other experimental features were observed. Synergistic effects, when all experimental factors were active, resulted in the highest rates of interactive feature use and the greatest proportion of participants at high levels of engagement. Measured in terms of standardized mean differences (SMDs), effects on interactive feature use were highest for Build Support System (SMD 0.56; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.81), Choose Quit Smoking Aid (SMD 0.38; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.66), and Track Smoking Triggers (SMD 0.33; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.61). Among the engagement metrics, the largest effects were on overall feature utilization (SMD 0.33; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.59) and time on site (SMD 0.29; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.57). As no SMD &gt;0.30 was observed for main effects on any outcome, results suggest that for some outcomes, the combined intervention was stronger than individual factors alone. Conclusions: This factorial experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of text messaging as a strategy to increase engagement with an internet smoking cessation intervention, resulting in greater overall intervention dose and greater exposure to the core components of tobacco dependence treatment that can promote abstinence.

Accordingly, a pervasive issue in psychology pertains to the kind of social–cognitive responses exposure to deadly threats generates. To this day, psychological models of reactions to death-related threats remain underspecified, especially with regards to modern evolutionary theory. Research on both humans and nonhuman primates’ reactions to death-related threats highlights a general tendency of human and nonhuman primates to “cling to the group” and to display increased social motivation in the face of death and deadly events (predator attacks, disasters, terror attacks. . .). Given the adaptive value of social networks, which provide individuals with resources, mating pool and support, we propose the existence of an evolved mechanism to explain these affiliative responses. In particular, we propose a “conspecific loss compensation mechanism” (CLCM) that actively keeps track of and compensates for threats to the integrity of one’s social network. In the face of death-related cues signaling a danger for one’s social network, or actual conspecific loss, CLCM triggers proportional affiliative responses by a process labeled compensatory socialization. After reviewing existing evidence for the CLCM, we discuss its plausibility, parsimonious character, and explanatory power of the diversity of responses observed among threatened and grieving individuals. We also formulate clear and novel predictions to be tested in future research.

Based on ethological observations reporting similar behavioral patterns and on the adaptive value of social networks, we hypothesize the existence of an evolved “conspecific loss compensation mechanism” (CLCM) that keeps track of and compensates for threats to the integrity of one’s social network. The CLCM parsimoniously explains a wide variety of empirical findings and allows the testing of novel predictions regarding human social cognition and behavior.

Big data methodologies can augment this endeavour by allowing for the collection of naturalistic and personality‐relevant digital traces from online environments. Whereas big data methods have primarily been used to catalogue static personality dimensions, here we present a case study in how they can be used to track dynamic fluctuations in psychological states. We apply a text‐based, machine learning prediction model to Facebook status updates to compute weekly trajectories of emotional valence and arousal. We train this model on 2895 human‐annotated Facebook statuses and apply the resulting model to 303 575 Facebook statuses posted by 640 US Facebook users who had previously self‐reported their Big Five traits, yielding an average of 28 weekly estimates per user. We examine the correlations between model‐predicted emotion and self‐reported personality, providing a test of the robustness of these links when using weekly aggregated data, rather than momentary data as in prior work. We further present dynamic visualizations of weekly valence and arousal for every user, while making the final data set of 17 937 weeks openly available. We discuss the strengths and drawbacks of this method in the context of personality psychology's evolution into a dynamic science. © 2020 European Association of Personality Psychology (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)","2020-05-21","2020-06-05 21:18:02","2020-06-05 21:18:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ENG","","","APA PsycInfo®","2406657665; 2020-36394-001","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons","","","http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Tracking+fluctuations+in+psychological+states+using+social+media+language%3A+A+case+study+of+weekly+emotion&title=European+Journal+of+Personality&issn=08902070&date=2020-05-21&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Eichstaedt%2C+Johannes+C.%3BWeidman%2C+Aaron+C.&isbn=&jtitle=European+Journal+of+Personality&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2020-36394-001&rft_id=info:doi/10.1002%2Fper.2261","article; personality; big data; emotion; experience sampling; 3100:Personality Psychology; No terms assigned; digital footprints","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Initial responses of professional sports leagues to implementation of acute concussion management practices and reports of a neurodegenerative condition known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) developing in retired players caused an atmosphere of distrust whereby the leagues were accused of maintaining cover-ups analogous to what had been seen in association with studies of tobacco and smoking. This article reviews the important role that psychology has played in the study of sports concussion and in the establishment of methods currently used to diagnose and track concussion symptoms. Results of existing studies have shown that the neurobiological effects of concussion are rather short-lived with development of persisting symptoms in some individuals associated more with psychosocial factors than underlying physiological effects. With regard to CTE, the status of the science remains preliminary with little definitive information known about its epidemiology or cause. In the midst of the ongoing controversy, a polarized climate has developed in association with concussion and CTE, divided by believers in the dangers of long-term consequences and deniers who question the status of the existing science. The conclusion is that it is important for psychology to extend its scope of study to provide increased understanding of the social factors underlying the current polarized climate while continuing to provide the public with an accurate and reliable account of the existing science.

Les premières réponses des ligues sportives professionnelles à la mise en œuvre de pratiques de gestion des commotions aiguës et les déclarations de maladie neurodégénérative connue sous le nom d’encéphalopathie traumatique chronique (CTE) en développement chez les joueurs retraités ont provoqué une atmosphère de méfiance où les ligues ont été accusées de dissimulations de manière similaire à ce qui avait été observé avec les études sur le tabac et le tabagisme. Le présent article examine le rôle important que la psychologie a joué dans l’étude des commotions liées au sport et dans l’établissement de méthodes actuellement utilisées pour diagnostiquer et surveiller les symptômes de commotion cérébrale. Les résultats des études existantes ont montré que les effets neurobiologiques de commotion cérébrale sont plutôt de courte durée avec l’apparition de symptômes persistants, chez certaines personnes, plutôt associés à des facteurs psychosociaux qu’aux effets physiologiques sous-jacents. En ce qui concerne la CTE, le statut de la science reste préliminaire, avec peu de renseignements définitifs connus sur son épidémiologie ou sa cause. Au cœur de la controverse actuelle, un climat polarisé s’est développé en lien avec la commotion cérébrale et la CTE, divisé par les croyants aux dangers des conséquences à long terme et les négateurs qui remettent en question le statut de la science existante.

The EVC items were comprehensively examined (n = 661) through factor analysis, item response theory, and linear regression. Results indicated that the instrument retained a three-factor structure as well as strict and structural invariance across age groups and education levels, but the Expectancy and Value items suffered from significant ceiling effects, a key difficulty in assessing motivation using this approach. As part of a regression model with learners' intentions, EVC scores did not account for a significant amount of variance in learners' assessment outcomes and course behavior. Challenges remain for adjusting to learners' high expectancy and value of courses at the beginning, and for fully understanding how scores relate to learner behavior.

"A9CQFR8V","thesis","2017","Donahue, Maria Magdalena Sandoval","Episodic uplift of the Rocky Mountains: Evidence from U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology and low-temperature thermochronology with a chapter on using mobile technology for geoscience education","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1904812316?accountid=14026","The timing and processes of development of the high topography and high relief of the southern Rocky Mountains of Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico has been controversial for over a hundred years. This study applies several different methodologies towards understanding the timing and relative importance of the events that uplifted and shaped the Rocky Mountains. These studies include incision studies (Chapter 1), detrital zircon analysis of Cenozoic fluvial deposits resting on the ""Rocky Mountain Erosion Surface (Chapter 2), and low temperature apatite fission track (AFT) and U-Th/He (AHe) low temperature thermochronology to look at differential cooling histories across the Rockies (Chapter 3). Chapter 4 investigates a project in which I designed and deployed a mobile device application for enhancing the traditional geoscience field education and research experience. Incision studies (Chapter 1) investigated the timing and rate of incision of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison by the Gunnison River. Canyon geometry is shaped by a headward-migrating knickzone presently located within the Painted Wall section of the Black Canyon. The Black Canyon knickpoint overlies a strong gradient between low velocity mantle under the Colorado Rockies and higher velocity mantle of the Colorado Plateau. We interpret drainage reorganization and transient incision of both the Gunnison and upper Colorado River systems to be responding to mantle-driven epeirogenic uplift of the southern Rockies in the last 10 Ma. This study (Chapter 2) investigates the timing of erosion and deposition of several fragmented and little-understood conglomerate and sedimentary units, which are then used to better understand the timing of formation of the enigmatic Rocky Mountain Erosion Surface. Detrital zircon studies reclassify the Telluride Conglomerate and Blanco Basin Formation as being of Oligocene age, with maximum depositional ages of 30+/-3 Ma. This requires new understanding of the uplift of the San Juan Mountain regions, as we interpret these units to be the conglomeratic/sedimentary response to pre-volcanic epeirogenic doming and unroofing. The third study (Chapter 3) moves to larger scales of both time and space in order to investigate uplift and exhumation histories on the regional scale. This study included a literature review and compilation of all published low-temperature thermochronology data (apatite fission track and apatite (U-Th)/He) (AHe) for the southern Rocky Mountain region and adds new apatite (U-Th)/He data on selected conglomeratic/sedimentary units to both add richness to the data base and to attempt to better constrain Oligocene burial histories. The fourth study highlights a project called Field Play. Our current human interaction with these landscapes is also of importance. The communication of science and education of Rockies both academic and public populations is of great importance as we have unprecedented access to information and rapidly evolving digital technologies. This project utilizes mobile technologies (smartphones, tablets) to augment the field experience. The goal of this project is to create a personalized, scalable and interactive educational learning environment which facilitates user exploration and access to robust geologic information. This project was featured in the New Mexico Geological Society's 2014 Fall Field Conference, as well as being used in my own teaching of introductory environmental science classes. This project is ongoing. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.).

For example, Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) may be time-critical after a natural disaster or an accident calls for the rapid location of survivors. Surveillance tasks are also examples of a search and tracking problem. One of the challenges for multiple agent search is the need for communication and coordination among the agents. A centralized structure with sufficient computing power can plan optimal paths, even though the search problem is known to be NP-hard. However, optimal path planning becomes intractable as the number of agents and the complexity of the map increase. Furthermore, a centralized controller requires a fully connected network. Alternatively, the search can be performed in a distributed manner if each agent has access to the target location estimates of one or more of its peers. However, if the communication network of the agents is not fully connected, they will not have shared access to a target location estimate. We present a framework for distributed mobile sensor guidance to locate and track a target inside an urban environment, with an approach that leverages available communications between the mobile sensor and which also allows them to act independently. Each sensor actively seeks the target using information maximization, and is capable of individually pursuing its goal. The sensors are assumed to be capable of detecting their peers within some distance radius, and each sensor is allowed to have target detection errors of types I and II. Our contributions include an algorithm for information-based target search that uses posterior entropy minimization without directly computing this quantity, a closed-form solution to the sensor placement problem for binary detectors, an augmented particle filter estimator that handles delayed or out-of-sequence measurements, and an optimal information fusion algorithm for discrete probability mass functions. This allows each agent to combine its local information with that of its neighbors, if any. We include simulations and laboratory experiments involving multiple robots searching for a moving target within model cities of different sizes.

"TJVU9ZX5","thesis","2017","Kay, Matthew Jeremy Shaver","Designing for user-facing uncertainty in everyday sensing and prediction","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1915375553?accountid=14026","As we reach the boundaries of sensing systems, we are increasingly building and deploying ubiquitous computing solutions that rely heavily on inference. Often, there is also a strong desire for simple sensors to reduce cost and deployment burden. Examples include using low-cost accelerometers to track step count or sleep quality (Fitbit), using microphones for cough tracking or fall detection, and using electrical noise and water pressure monitoring to track appliances' water and electricity use. A common thread runs across these systems: they rely on inference, hence their output has uncertainty it has an associated error that researchers attempt to minimize and this uncertainty is user-facing it directly affects the quality of the user experience. As we push more of these sorts of sensing and prediction systems into our everyday day lives, we should ask: does the uncertainty in their output affect how people use and trust these systems? If so, how can we design them to be better? While existing literature suggests communicating uncertainty may affect trust, little evidence of this effect in real, deployed systems has been available. I wanted to start with the simplest, most ubiquitous sensing system I could think of to see if a failure to communicate uncertainty might affect trust or usage. I turned to the home weight scale, a sensing system that has been with us for at least 100 years, but which maintains at the moment of measurement about the simplest feedback interface possible: it just tells you your weight! I conducted a series of studies, starting with qualitative investigations into people's understanding of uncertainty in weight scales, through a study of actual variability in scale measurements, to an online survey of attitudes towards scales from a large number of scale users. I found that many people judge their scales by their perceived uncertainty, but often confuse aspects of error like bias and variance when doing so. I found that people who have a better understanding of weight variability trust their scales more. I found that the scale does little to help people along in their understanding of error at the moment of weigh-in. The design of the scale is today causing problems with trust and abandonment. How can we design it better? To investigate how to communicate uncertainty effectively to people, I turned to another domain: realtime transit prediction. I wanted to understand how to communicate uncertainty in a way that people grasp more viscerally. I sought to develop a visualization of a continuous measure (time to arrival) that capitalizes on a frequency-based (or discrete) representation to improve people's probabilistic estimates. I introduced a novel visualization technique, quantile dotplots, that capitalizes on both a discrete presentation of uncertainty and people's fast-counting abilities (called subitizing) to improve the precision of their probabilistic estimates by about 15%. If my work in weight scales asks what happens when we get it wrong, this work aims to build an understanding of how to get it right. Finally, effective design for user-facing uncertainty is not limited to the visual communication of uncertainty: it is not enough to slap an effective visualization on top of whatever model exists in a predictive system. In even conceptually simple prediction tasks is it going to rain today? people exhibit preferences for different types of errors. In precipitation prediction, this manifests as wet bias [82] the tendency of weather forecasters to over-predict the probability of rain to reduce the chance that people do not prepare for rain and then blame the forecaster when they are rained on. Even an effective representation of uncertainty in this case might not be optimal if the model is not tuned to reflect people's error preferences.

Specifically, this study examines three goals: a) the difference between students who choose to participate in private tutoring and students who does not choose to participate in private tutoring in terms of their background information, b) the factors influencing students' Gaokao performance, and c) the mechanism of how private tutoring and other factors influence students' Gaokao performance. This study adopts three theoretical perspectives to explore the relationship between private tutoring and Chinese students' Gaokao performance: 1) Dang and Rogers' (2008) supply and demand framework in education with private tutoring; 2) Beruvides' (1997) learning curve model with threshold region; and 3) the educational production function (Hanushek, 1979). The supply and demand framework in education with private tutoring helps people understand the interaction of supply and demand for public education (and private tutoring) in different situations. It indicates that households can consume more education after public education cannot meet their demand when the private tutoring is available (Dang & Rogers, 2008). The learning theory and the learning curve model provide a crucial framework to explain why parents and students demand private tutoring. By adopting the educational production function, this study was able to investigate the relationship between private tutoring and students' Gaokao performance. In this study, a survey on students' shadow education participation was developed as the instrument. This study employed a quantitative approach. Descriptive statistics were used to examine students' background characteristics, students' family socioeconomic status, and private tutoring participation information. Independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests were conducted to identify the differences between students who participated in private tutoring before college and those who did not. Multiple regression analyses were administrated to investigate the factors (including private tutoring) that influence students' Gaokao score. A Path analysis was employed to measure the robustness of a proposed model. The results indicated that students who participated in private tutoring had the characteristics that much more being female, more had non-agricultural registered residence status, lived in the urban areas and chose the social science track in high school. Less of them were first generation college students. In terms of the variables measuring participants' financial status, students who participated in private tutoring were more likely to have an apartment or a house and to have internet access and air conditioners at home. However, less of these students reported being top 20% of the class during high school. The results of independent samples t-tests and Pearson chi-square tests indicated that there is statistically significant difference in background characteristics including, parental education level, class rank in high school, gender, registered residence status, location of residence, and academic track in high school, between students who participated in private tutoring and students who did not participate in private tutoring. The multiple regression analysis showed that gender, class rank in high school, academic track, parental educational level, and private tutoring were statistically significant factors on students' Gaokao performance.

"2HFXXIKI","thesis","2017","Pisor, Anne Catherine","The perfect stranger: Resource access and the evolution of out-group relationships","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1918854902?accountid=14026","Unlike non-human primates, humans are highly tolerant of out-group strangers, as evidenced by the ethnographic and archaeological records; however, very little research has addressed when and why people build relationships with out-group individuals. What selection pressures might have favored inter-group relationship building in humans? As reducing temporal variation in resource access has been crucial in the human foraging ecology, I suggest that relationships with out-group members may provide access to non-local resources and buffer resource shortfalls striking entire communities. The relevance of out-group relationships is not limited to small-scale or prehistoric contexts either, as out-group members can also provide access to difficult-to-access resources like market items. My research program is focused on the above question; in my dissertation, I address three components of it: Which social and ecological factors favor out-group relationships? What do people look for when picking partners from out-groups? When people value out-group members, will they avoid behavior that would inflict costs on these individuals? Among three populations of horticulturalists in Bolivia, I measured valuation for out-group members using a non-anonymous economic game in which participants could be generous to in-group and out-group strangers. I found that participants were highly generous to both in-group and out-group strangers. Participants invest more in out-group relationships when they have less non-local (i.e., market) resource access, as proxied by their subjective socioeconomic status relative to others in their community. As has been demonstrated in the literature on in-group partner choice, participants prefer strangers perceived to be ""good people"" (a term associated with cooperative qualities in the Bolivian context). I also expected that out-group partner choice would track opportunities for resource access; indeed, participants also give more to strangers from out-groups perceived to have more market or political resource access. That said, the effect of resource access on out-group valuation and out-group partner choice varied by proxy. In a 55-country sample, I found that participants were less likely to condone corrupt acts, which generate costs for others, when they identified with larger groups of individuals, a proxy for valuation of these individuals. However, there was a caveat: participants with local identities were as opposed to corrupt acts as those with country, continent, or world identities, while those with regional identities were the most willing to condone corrupt acts. Consistent with my suggestion that out-group members buffer actors against variation in resource access, participants experiencing the greatest degree of resource shortfalls were more likely to not find corruption permissible; however, this was also true of those experiencing the least amount of shortfall. In sum, valuation for out-group partnerships does track resource access in three populations of horticulturalists and a sample from 55 counties, but the effect varies by measure in instructive ways. For example, the negative relationship between market items owned and out-group valuation in one population may reflect experiences of discrimination in market contexts, rather than a lack of utility for out-group relationships per se. As discussed in the conclusion, my ongoing and future work capitalizes on these variable effects as it delves further into the nature of out-group relationships in the Bolivian context.

"HXGCU5YV","thesis","2017","Milburn, Travis W.","Bakken bombs: A criminological inquiry into the Lynchburg train derailment","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1924849331?accountid=14026","In recent years, several significant train derailments involving the transportation of crude oil have dotted the North American landscape. Each resulted in environmental and social harm to some degree which was extensive in many instances. Oil train derailments have occurred in places such as Lac-Megantic, Canada (July 2013), Casselton, North Dakota (December 2013 and November 2014), and Mount Carbon, West Virginia (February 2015). Following derailments, communities have faced substantial environmental damage, human death and injury, and overall disruption from the explosions and subsequent oil spills that characterize these events. This project specifically examined the April 30, 2014 derailment in Lynchburg, Virginia. A CSX-operated train containing 104 oil tank cars derailed which caused 17 cars to leave the tracks; 3 of these cars plunged over the bank of the James River and became submerged. The derailment resulted in a large explosion and subsequent fire that burned for over an hour after one tank car ruptured and lost its contents. It was estimated that nearly 30,000 gallons of crude oil were spilled (NTSB 2016). Serious environmental and human health concerns resulted, particularly fears that downstream cities, including the state capitol of Richmond, would have contaminated water. Through a lens of green criminology, victimology, and securitization, this dissertation examines perceptions of criminality, victimization, and ecological harm as a result of the oil train derailment among members of the Lynchburg community. The environmental and social consequences of the Lynchburg train derailment are considered through a case study approach that is situated within the politics surrounding oil extraction and transportation within the US and Canada where dramatically expanded rail transport of oil has resulted in an influx in derailments in recent years. Interviews with 22 individuals---officials, environmentalists, witnesses, and members of the Lynchburg community---were used to examine the extent and nature of harm to the environment, community, and individuals as a result of the oil train derailment including the aftermath of the event. Official documents and media representations supplement the in-depth interviews. This case study reveals an array of victimizations and differing ideas about responsibility and criminality in the wake of the event. Security has been inserted into the realities of oil train shipment by the railroad industry which has problematized the dissemination of information about these volatile shipments to communities who experience them. Significant identities with both the James River and the railroad within the community have served to help make sense of the derailment, framed ideas about responsibility and culpability, and determined the conceptualization of the environment as a victim.

Our study is motivated by the experiences of the semiconductor and LCD industries, we investigate the impact of reciprocity in the dyadic supply chain. A notable characteristic in the above technology industries is the alternating possession of bargaining power caused by cyclical demand. We incorporate a reciprocal game in a dyadic supply channel over two periods. We investigate how a supplier is influenced and protects himself during the oversupply period by anticipating the buyer's reciprocal behavior. Our results show that a supplier's understanding of a buyer's reciprocal behavior can mitigate double marginalization and can even fully coordinate the channel. This implies that even without a costly mechanism to resolve the double marginalization, appropriate consideration of the counterpart will increase channel efficiency. In the second essay, we consider a firm that manages a portfolio of customers placing orders that need replacement parts. The firm has both long-term and short-term customers. A long-term customer places both routine orders for routine maintenance and urgent orders due to emergency with a low margin for the firm and a short-term customer places urgent orders with a high margin for the firm. Routine orders provide stable loads and generate efficiency. Considering the increase in efficiency by routine orders, there is a trade-off between the efficiency and profitability of the order portfolio. Motivated by data provided by the company, we build an analytical model to support optimal decision making. We identify the impact of an additional urgent order to the cost embedded in the future operations. Finally, we model the mixed integer program to support the company's capacity plan. We conclude with in sights provided to the firm and managerial insights for optimal customer order portfolios. In the third essay, we focus on the economic benefit of profound technology projects as milestones are achieved. Ce-Al alloy project by CMI promotes an example. The project we use replaces the current aluminum (Al) alloy with Al-cerium (Ce) alloy in an engine block and an engine head to increase the operational efficiency of the vehicle. We can expect higher fuel efficiency as well as a lower cost of production. The Ce-Al alloy development project by the Critical Material Institute (CMI) announces an achievement level at every milestone. The model keeps track of two goals, efficiency improvement and production cost reduction. Based on the progress about those two R&D tracks, the research question involves when to add capacity for production to maximize profits and how to adjust the R&D strategy to maximize benefit. The problem is modeled in a Bayesian update and a stochastic dynamic program. Insights from the model were used to estimate the economic benefit for CMI and suggestion for improvement.

"7IHGMSZK","thesis","2017","Bambach, Sven","Analyzing hands with first-person computer vision","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1925843514?accountid=14026","Egocentric cameras aim to approximate a person's field of view, which provides insight into how people interact with the world. Consequently, many cognitive researchers are interested in using wearable camera systems as tools to study attention, perception, and learning. These systems typically capture vast amounts of image data, so to fully harness the potential of this novel observational paradigm, sophisticated techniques to automatically annotate and understand the data are needed. However, analyzing first-person imagery introduces many unique challenges, as it is usually recorded passively without artistic intent and therefore lacks many of the clean characteristics of traditional photography. This thesis presents novel computer vision approaches to automatically analyze first-person imaging data. The focus of these approaches lies in extracting and understanding hands in the egocentric field of view. Hands are almost omnipresent and constitute our primary channel of interaction with the physical world. To that end, we argue that analyzing hands is an important factor towards the goal of automatically understanding human behavior from egocentric images and videos. We propose three different approaches that aim to extract meaningful and useful information about hands in the context of social interactions. First, we consider laboratory videos of joint toy play between infants and parents, and develop a method to track and, importantly, distinguish hands based on spatial constraints imposed by the egocentric paradigm. This method allows us to collect fine-grained hand appearance statistics that contribute new evidence towards how infants and their parents coordinate attention through eye-hand coordination. Next, we build upon this approach to develop a general, probabilistic framework that jointly models temporal and spatial biases of hand locations. We demonstrate that this approach achieves notable results in disambiguating hands even when combined with noisy initial detections that may occur in naturalistic videos. Finally, we ask to what extent we can identify hand types and poses directly based on visual appearances. We collect a large-scale egocentric video dataset with pixel-level hand annotations to permit the training of data-driven recognition models like convolutional neural networks. Results indicate that not only can we distinguish hands, but also infer activities from hand poses.

"28DZFXAI","thesis","2017","Wang, Wenjun","Modeling influence diffusion in networks for community detection, resilience analysis and viral marketing","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1928290825?accountid=14026","The past decades have seen a fast-growing and dynamic trend of network science and its applications. From the Internet to Facebook, from telecommunications to power grids, from protein interactions to paper citations, networks are everywhere and the network paradigm is pervasive. Network analysis and mining has become an important tool for scientific research and industrial applications to diverse domains. For example, finding communities within social networks enables us to identify groups of densely connected customers who may share similar interests and behaviors and thus generate more effective recommender systems; investigating the supply-network topological structure and growth model improves the resilience of supply networks against disruptions; and modeling influence diffusion in social networks provides insights into viral marketing strategies. However, none of these tasks is trivial. In fact, community detection, resilience analysis, and influence-diffusion modeling are all important challenges in complex networks. My PhD research contributes to these endeavors by exploring the implicit knowledge of connectivity and proximity encoded in the network graph topology. Our research originated from an attempt to find communities in networks. After carefully examining real-life communities and the features and limitations of a set of widely-used centrality measures, we develop a simple but powerful reachability-based influence-diffusion model. Based upon this model, we propose a new influence centrality and a novel shared-influence-neighbor (SIN) similarity. The former differentiates the comprehensive influence significance more precisely, and the latter gives rise to a refined vertex-pair closeness metric. Then we develop an influence-guided spherical K-means (IGSK) algorithm for community detection. Further, we propose two novel influence-guided label propagation (IGLP) algorithms for finding hierarchical communities in complex networks. Experiments on both real-life networks and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate superior performance of our algorithms in both undirected/directed and unweighted/weighted networks. Another research topic we investigated is resilience analysis of supply networks. Supply networks play an important role in product distribution, and survivability is a critical concern in supply-network design and analysis. We exploit the resilience embedded in supply-network topology by exploring the multiple-path reachability of each demand node to other nodes, and propose a novel resilience metric. We also develop new supply-network growth mechanisms that reflect the heterogeneous roles of different types of units in supply networks. We incorporate them into two fundamental network topologies (random-graph topology and scale-free topology), and evaluate the resilience under random disruptions and targeted attacks using the new resilience metric. The experimental results verify the validity of our resilience metric and the effectiveness of our growth model. This research provides a generic framework and important insights into the construction of robust supply networks. Finally, we investigate activation-based influence-diffusion modeling for viral marketing. One of the fundamental problems in viral marketing is to find a small set of initial adopters who can trigger the largest further adoptions through word-of-mouth-based influence propagation in the network. We propose a novel multiple-path asynchronous threshold (MAT) model, in which we quantitatively measure influence and keep track of its diffusion and aggregation during the diffusion process. Our MAT model captures both direct and indirect influence, influence attenuation along diffusion paths, temporal influence decay, and individual diffusion dynamics. Our work is an important step toward a more realistic diffusion model.

Methods: Data from NHANES 2003–2006 were analyzed using linear and ordered logistic regression analyses. A total of 4794 individuals aged 18–69 years with valid physical activity and DXA data were included. Objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behavior were assessed using accelerometers, self-reported physical activity using the NHANES physical activity questionnaire. Weight, height, WC and DXA measures were assessed in the mobile examination centers. Results: We observed statistically significant associations between objectively measured moderate and vigorous physical activity and all definitions of overweight/obesity. For total physical activity, the odds of being in the higher percent body fat category were 0.56 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41, 0.77) for the medium and 0.30 (95% CI 0.22, 0.40) for the highest physical activity tertile compared with the lowest. For light activities, lifestyle activities and sedentary behavior, associations were only observed in the linear models with percent total body fat but not in the ordered logistic regression models. Regarding self-reported physical activity, consistent significant associations with overweight/obesity were only observed for vigorous and for transport activity. Conclusions: Regarding moderate and vigorous physical activity, more active individuals were less affected by overweight/ obesity than less active individuals, emphasizing the public health effect of physical activity in the prevention of overweight/ obesity. The fact that associations were more consistent for objectively measured than for self-reported physical activity may be due to bias related to self-reporting. Associations between lower intensity activities and overweight/obesity were weak or inexistent.

"3I5QLW55","thesis","2017","Adikariwattage, Varuna","Service quality benchmarking methodology for airport passenger terminals based on level of facility provision","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1932892807?accountid=14026","Service quality in airport terminals is considered very important to multiple stake holders including passengers, airlines, airport operator, concessionaires and local community. A critical need for the airport industry is the availability of techniques for evaluating the service quality provided to passengers. Defining overall service quality standards is important in terms of designing, managing and benchmarking the service quality of a passenger terminal. Currently there is no technique capable of defining overall service quality standards for airport terminals using objectively defined service performance criteria. Objective measurement is defined as service performance measurements determined using quantitative measurements that cannot be subjected to value criticism. This thesis presents a comprehensive technique for determining standards of overall service quality at airport passenger terminals using objectively measured service performance criteria. Criteria for defining overall service quality standards is determined based on the value of relative importance of different service attributes at the passenger terminal. Passenger opinion was used to determine the value of attribute relative importance. A stated preference survey format was used to collect data from the passengers in order to calculate values of attribute relative importance. Advantages achieved with the technique are its versatility of recruiting respondents with a wider representation of the target population and the ability to cover a wider range of service attributes within the survey. Respondents were recruited at the main terminal of The Calgary International airport and online. Discrete choice modelling and generalised ordinal regression analysis were used as main analysis models. Finally a comprehensive evaluation scheme is developed as a tool to measure the overall service quality of a given airport terminal relative to the overall service quality standards defined by the study. The main contribution of the research is the development of a methodology to establish overall service quality standards and the evaluation scheme for overall service quality measurement at airport terminals. Future work is recommended to extend this methodology and develop a comprehensive industry application with industry wide consensus.

A key challenge is to capture and understand student behavior at fidelity sufficient to estimate cognitive and affective states as they manifest through multiple media, including speech, body pose, gestures and gaze. However, analyzing each of these modalities in isolation may result in incongruities. In addition, the affective states of a person show significant variations in time. To address these technical challenges, this paper presents a framework for developing hierarchical computational models that provide a systematic approach for extracting meaningful evidence from noisy, unstructured data. This approach utilizes multimodal data, including audio, video, and activity log files and models the temporal dynamics of student behavior patterns. To demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology, we present two pilot studies from the domains of collaborative learning and in vivo assessments of nonverbal behavior where this approach has been successfully implemented.

The solution utilizes a computer vision-based system to track tagged 3D printed geometric shapes which can be manipulated by the child and provides feedback via an audio interface. The aim is to create an engaging, accessible system which mitigates the demands on the time, efforts and financial resources of the teacher/caregiver and allows a child to learn and review these concepts autonomously at his/her own pace. 3D printing has been utilized for generating the tangible tokens and off-the-shelf components have been used for setting up the TUI in order to make the system low-cost, customizable, easily reproducible and do-it-yourself. The evaluation of the system with teachers of VI children has not only validated its potential and affirmed the need for and the willingness of the teachers to adopt such assistive solutions but has also provided some invaluable insights which would be a useful resource for other researchers interested in building similar applications. The system would be extended in the future to allow teachers/caregivers to create custom shapes and to teach other essential concepts such as object sequencing and texture recognition.

Design/methodology/approach: This research uses a mixed-methods approach, employing both descriptive quantitative techniques and qualitative thematic analysis. Findings: Qualitative analyses of online news comments on  BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post revealed that publics’ reaction to the cyber-attack on Sony, the following threats of attack, and Sony’s response to it largely ran counter to the situational crisis communication theory’s (SCCT) assumptions about victim cluster crises. Analyses also revealed a pattern in the volume of comments on the two online news outlets, supporting the conceptualization of hot-issue publics growing and decreasing as news coverage of an issue rises and falls. Research limitations/implications: The analysis was limited to one incident and two online media. Practical implications: This paper provides empirical support for the use of online news comments to track hot-issue publics and what is important to them. In addition, tracking the tone and content of the comments allows for an examination of the fit of SCCT assumptions and provides a way for practitioners to understand public opinion and adapt communication plans based on insights gleaned from such data. Originality/value: This study is one of few to provide empirical support for the conceptualization of hot-issue publics, and to do so using online news comments. In addition, it is one of very few to study the SCCT in real-world settings, examining real publics’ reactions to real issues.

Here, bringing together concepts from social network theory, animal personality, and parasite manipulation of host behaviour, I argue that not only are social networks shaping parasite transmission, but parasites in turn shape social networks through their effects on the behaviour of infected individuals. Firstly, I review five general categories of behaviour (mating behaviour, aggressiveness, activity levels, spatial distribution, and group formation) that are closely tied to social networks, and provide evidence that parasites can affect all of them. Secondly, I describe scenarios in which behaviour-altering parasites can modify either the role or position of individual hosts within their social network, or various structural properties (e.g., connectance, modularity) of the entire network. Experimental approaches allowing comparisons of social networks pre- versus post-infection are a promising avenue to explore the feedback loop between social networks and parasite infections.

We introduce the term Human–pet–computer interaction (HPCI) as the study of how technology can be designed and used to advance human–pet companionships. As an example, we describe  CompanionViz, a personal information visualization prototype designed to inform pet owners on their dogs’ caloric inputs/outputs, as well as exercise and movement habits. We present a user study of CompanionViz featuring a twelve-participant survey and one field study, consisting of three unique use cases, and show that by providing pet owners with quantifiable awareness of their dogs’ health and exercise habits using personal visual representations, pet owner–dog bonds can benefit.

Although laptops are a valuable tool, they offer access to a distracting temptation: the Internet. In the study reported here, we assessed the relationship between classroom performance and actual Internet usage for academic and nonacademic purposes. Students who were enrolled in an introductory psychology course logged into a proxy server that monitored their online activity during class. Past research relied on self-report, but the current methodology objectively measured time, frequency, and browsing history of participants’ Internet usage. In addition, we assessed whether intelligence, motivation, and interest in course material could account for the relationship between Internet use and performance. Our results showed that nonacademic Internet use was common among students who brought laptops to class and was inversely related to class performance. This relationship was upheld after we accounted for motivation, interest, and intelligence. Class-related Internet use was not associated with a benefit to classroom performance.

This study investigates the relationship between opinion leaders and their psychosocial health benefits by considering two overarching questions: (a) Who are the opinion leaders? (b) What role do these opinion leaders play in explaining health outcomes? The data analyzed in this study resulted from merging human-coded content analysis of discussion group messages, action log data analysis of interactive health system usage, and longitudinal survey data. Surveys were administered to 221 women with breast cancer; participants were provided free access to and training for the CMSS groups developed by the Comprehensive Health Support System (CHESS) project. The findings suggest that opinion leaders obtained psychosocial health benefits, such as higher levels of cancer information competence, breast cancer knowledge, and better problem-focused coping strategies. Those who had a higher baseline level of breast cancer knowledge and optimism in coping with challenges in their life were more likely to act as opinion leaders. Implications for research and improving psychosocial interventions for people with health concerns are discussed.

To evaluate the viability of using sensing methods to monitor such behaviors in detail, the present research used a smartphone-sensing application to describe the patterns of stability and change that characterize a cohort of students' activity and sociability behaviors over the course of a 10-week academic term. Data were collected from 48 students using a smartphone-sensing application,  StudentLife, which was designed to track daily durations of activity (via the accelerometer sensor) and sociability (via the microphone sensor). Results showed stability estimates were moderate to high for activity (r mean = 0.66) and sociability (r mean = 0.72) across the 10 weeks. Students started the term with generally healthy levels of activity ( M = 1.87 h) and sociability ( M = 4.99 h), which then dropped (activity by 0.42 h, sociability by 0.90 h) over the first half of the term (i.e., before midterm exams). Over the second half of the term, activity levels did not change but sociability increased (by 0.88 h). Students’ ethnicity and academic class predicted variation in the activity and sociability trajectories. Discussion focuses on the implications of our results for designing mHealth interventions to address consequential student outcomes (e.g., mental health, physical health).

This data holds promise for assessing brand health. However, before adopting brand search volume as a brand metric, marketers should understand how brand search relates to traditional survey-based measures of brand attitudes, which have been shown to be predictive of sales. We investigate the relationship between brand attitudes and search engine queries using a unique micro-level data set collected from a panel of Google users who agreed to allow us to track their individual brand search behavior over eight weeks and link this search history to their responses to a brand attitude survey. Focusing on the smartphone and automotive markets, we find that users who are actively shopping in a category are more likely to search for any brand. Further, as users move from being aware of a brand to intending to purchase a brand, they are increasingly more likely to search for that brand, with the greatest gains as customers go from recognition to familiarity and from familiarity to consideration. Additionally, users that own and use a particular automotive or smartphone brand are much more likely to search for that brand, even when they are not in market suggesting that a substantial volume of brand search in these categories is not related to shopping or product search. We discuss the implications of these findings for assessing brand health from search data.

Although stress-related reactions could sometimes provoke impairments in physiological processes due to the frequency of exposure or the stress burden of the event, physiological recovery after coping with stressors is highly implied in the aversive consequences of stress. To analyze the effects of listening to relaxing music (generated by the Melomics computer system) on the cardiovascular recovery and subjective feelings of anxiety after undergoing an acute-stress episode, a double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in healthy adults ( N = 24; M = 23.05 years, SD = 2.97). Participants reported their levels of psychiatric symptomatology and anxiety and were then exposed to a stress induction protocol. Afterward, they underwent a period of recovery where they would be exposed to either a relaxing music track or silence, depending on a random assignation. Heart-derived functioning and self-reported anxiety were monitored throughout the study stages. All the participants showed stress-related reactions throughout the study stages, as it was shown for the study outcomes. Regarding the effect of listening to music, participants who listened to relaxing music during the recovery stage showed higher levels of sample entropy than controls, highlighting a large effect size on this difference (η² partial = .59). Relaxing music promotes more adaptive emotional regulation after coping with an acutely stressful event. This study aims to shed light on the actual effects of music interventions, and encourage the use of music-based interventions on health services.

This involves longitudinally capturing learners’ judgments or linguistic production along with their response times in order to investigate how specific skills become automatic over time. However, previous research in this area has been conducted mostly in laboratories (i.e., in vitro), sometimes with artificial languages, thereby compromising ecological validity of the findings. Building on this work, this article reports on a one-month study in which learners’ ( N = 126) behaviour was tracked while they practised two constructions of English grammar (varying in complexity) using mini-games that involved some time pressure and were embedded in meaning-focused reading and discussion activities in class. Feedback was randomly varied between participants. Multilevel statistical analyses of accuracy and response time suggest that practice helped to develop automaticity, and that rule complexity and metalinguistic feedback played a role. The methodological innovation of this study consists of the application of in vitro experimental research techniques in in vivo L2 learning contexts and of the use of statistical mixed effects models to account for the complexity of real-life tracking data.

Because they rest on fundamentally different assumptions and algorithms, the two approaches are usually treated as antithetical, or even incommensurable. Drawing on cumulative prospect theory (CPT; Tversky & Kahneman, 1992) as the currently most influential instance of a descriptive algebraic model, we demonstrate how the two modeling traditions can be linked. CPT’s algebraic functions characterize choices in terms of psychophysical (diminishing sensitivity to probabilities and outcomes) as well as psychological (risk aversion and loss aversion) constructs. Models of heuristics characterize choices as rooted in simple information-processing principles such as lexicographic and limited search. In computer simulations, we estimated CPT’s parameters for choices produced by various heuristics. The resulting CPT parameter profiles portray each of the choice-generating heuristics in psychologically meaningful ways—capturing, for instance, differences in how the heuristics process probability information. Furthermore, CPT parameters can reflect a key property of many heuristics, lexicographic search, and track the environment-dependent behavior of heuristics. Finally, we show, both in an empirical and a model recovery study, how CPT parameter profiles can be used to detect the operation of heuristics. We also address the limits of CPT’s ability to capture choices produced by heuristics. Our results highlight an untapped potential of CPT as a measurement tool to characterize the information processing underlying risky choice.

However, many content analysis tools require researchers to choose between the validity of human-based coding and the ability to analyze large volumes of content through computer-based techniques. This study argues for the use of supervised content analysis tools that capitalize on the strengths of human- and computer-based coding for assessing opinion expression. We begin by outlining the key methodological issues surrounding content analysis as performed by human coders and existing computational algorithms. After reviewing the most popular analytic approaches, we introduce an alternative, hybrid method that is aimed at improving reliability, validity, and efficiency when analyzing social media content. To demonstrate the usefulness of this method, we track nuclear energy- and nanotechnology-related opinion expression on Twitter surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi accident to examine the extent to which the volume and tone of tweets shift in directions consistent with the expected external influence of the event. Our analysis revealed substantial shifts in both the volume and tone of nuclear power-related tweets that were consistent with our expectations following the disaster event. Conversely, there was decidedly more stability in the volume and tone of tweets for our comparison issue. These analyses provide an empirical demonstration of how the presented hybrid method can analyze defined communication sentiment and topics from large-scale social media data sets. The implications for communication scholars are discussed.

Methods: A 65-year-old woman with a five-year history of PSP and frequent falls presented for physical therapy. Her case was complicated by poor ability to visually track objects, axial rigidity, retropulsion, poor postural control with reaching and declines in cognitive awareness. Intervention was provided using the Xbox Kinect for 12 one-hour sessions over six weeks in an outpatient setting. Games were selected to challenge functional motor and cognitive tasks based on patient enjoyment. Results: The Xbox Kinect intervention may have contributed to a decline in falls and maintenance of scores on the BBS, TUG and 10 Meter Walk Tests above fall risk values. A decline in quality of life measures, PDQ-39 and FFABQ, may be attributed to an increase in cognitive awareness of deficits promoted by the intervention structure. Conclusion: Implementation of a gaming intervention using the Xbox Kinect is feasible for reducing fall risk, maintaining function and improving cognitive awareness when used in an outpatient setting.

However, people’s reasons for desistance vary considerably. This study evaluated the acceptability, utility, and predictive validity of questions that ask about people’s reasons for wanting to successfully complete probation. Substance-using probationers (N = 113) participated in a web-based computer intervention that targeted substance use and treatment initiation. Questions around seven dimensions of reasons for completing probation were developed to provide tailored feedback during the web-based program. A principle components factor analysis found that survey items loaded onto two distinct factors. Factor one, “Tangible Loss” focused on external and present-focused reasons. Factor two, “Better Life” focused on internal and future-focused reasons. There was a significant negative association between Better Life scores and days of substance use after two months (β = −0.31, SE = 0.13, p < 0.05). There was a significant positive association with Better Life scores and days of treatment attendance (β = 1.46, SE = 0.26, p < 0.001). Tangible Loss scores were no associated with substance use and treatment attendance. These findings may help to create more effective motivational tracks in e-health interventions, and may complement traditional motivation measures with an explicit focus on people’s stated reasons for wanting to complete probation.

We created two versions of an educational game for learning policy argumentation called Policy World. The game (only) version provided minimal feedback and penalized students for errors whereas the game+tutor version provided additional step-level teaching feedback and immediate error correction. A total of 105 university students played either the game or game+tutor version of Policy World in a randomized, controlled, two-group, between-subjects experiment, during which we measured students’ problem-solving abilities, interest in the game, self-reported competence, and pre- and posttest performance. The game+tutor version increased learning of policy analysis skills and self-reported competence. A path analysis supported the claim that greater assistance helped students to learn analysis better, which increased their feelings of competence, which increased their interest in the game. Log data of student behavior showed that debate performance improved only for students who had sufficiently mastered analysis. This study shows that we can design interesting and effective games to teach policy argumentation and how increasing tutoring and reducing penalties in educational games can increase learning without sacrificing interest.

With the presentation of stimuli using computer screens or projectors, the common idea focuses on measuring the eye movement or head and/or body movement to characterize changes of the head gaze. However, traditional methods rely on either the invasive fixation of animals, or the judgment of a human observer who reports the stimulus-tracking movements. In this paper, we propose a novel head gaze determination system to automatically track the head movement of rats without artificial markers. The experiments were done to demonstrate the process of optimizing parameters in image processing. As a result, the head angle curve of the proposed method is consistent with that of ground-truth data annotated manually according to predefined rules. Hence, the proposed method provides a simple, convenient, and objective solution to automatically generate the head gaze orientations from massive amounts of recorded data for further visual performance analysis.

The goal of this event-related brain potentials (ERPs) study was to track the neural activity associated with the violation of expectations about hostile versus nonhostile intentions in aggressive and nonaggressive individuals and examine how this neural activity relates to self-reported hostile attributional bias and impulsive aggression in real life. To this end, scenarios with a hostile versus nonhostile social context followed by a character’s ambiguous aversive behavior were presented to readers, and ERPs to critical words that specified the hostile versus nonhostile intent behind the behavior were analysed. Thirty-seven aggressive and fifty nonaggressive individuals participated in the study. The presentation of a critical word that violated hostile expectation caused an N400 response that was significantly larger in aggressive than nonaggressive individuals. Results also showed an enhanced late positive potential-like component in aggressive individuals when hostile intention scenarios took place in a nonhostile context, which is associated with impulsive aggression in real life even after having controlled for the effect of self-reported hostile attributional bias. The Hostile Expectancy Violation paradigm evaluated in this study represents a promising tool to investigate the relationship between the online processing of hostile intent in others and impulsive aggression.

The erratum reports the following acknowledgments that were partially omitted from the author note: Data used in this article were collected by the Laboratory for the Study of Stress, Immunity, and Disease. The data were accessed via the Common Cold Project website. Additional grants that supported the collection of these data and clinical and regulatory assistance. The full correction is listed in the erratum.] Objective: Loneliness is a well-established risk factor for poor physical health. Much less is known about how loneliness affects patient-reported outcomes (PROs), such as somatic symptoms, which are increasingly important for guiding symptom management and assessing quality of patient care. The current study investigates whether (a) loneliness and social isolation predict cold symptoms independent of each other, and (b) whether loneliness is a more robust risk factor than objective social isolation for experiencing cold symptoms. Method: As part of a larger parent study, 213 healthy participants completed the Short Loneliness Scale (LON) and the Social Network Index (SNI) at baseline. They were given nasal drops containing rhinovirus 39 (RV39; i.e., a common cold virus), then quarantined for 5 days during which they reported on subjective cold symptoms in addition to being monitored for objective indicators of infection. Data from 160 of the participants (who were infected with the virus) were used in the present analyses. Results: A hierarchical multiple regression revealed that baseline loneliness predicted self-reported cold symptoms over time (assessed via area under the curve), over and above demographic variables, season of participation, and depressive affect. Interestingly, social network size and diversity did not predict cold symptoms. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the perception of loneliness is more closely linked to self-reported illness symptoms than objectively measured social isolation. Assessing psychosocial factors such as loneliness when treating and evaluating the common cold could contribute to health care practitioners’ understanding of their patients’ experiences with acute illness.

The authors value the work of Stemler and Sternberg for initiating the discussion of what they should strive for in education and in society, and their first empirical results. Psychology is an empirical scientific enterprise, and as long as we want to use scientifically valid arguments to select students there are still many challenges to overcome. Performance sampling based admission procedures can be a next step to a solution where the authors carefully think about aligning mission, implementation, and assessment. Stemler also provided some interesting and useful applications and extensions of sample-based assessments, such as massive open online courses (MOOCs) and the use of test-monitoring software.

Here, we used a computer-based task to examine operant acquisition and extinction of avoidance in participants with and without severe self-reported PTSD symptoms. A total of 119 participants (77 male, 42 female; 74 veteran, 45 civilian) with symptoms (PTSS;  n = 63) or with few/no symptoms (noPTSS; n = 56) performed a task, in which they controlled a spaceship and could shoot a target to gain points or hide in “safe areas” to escape or avoid on-screen aversive events. Results show that participants with PTSS exhibited more avoidance across trials than noPTSS participants, particularly due to more avoidance behavior in PTSS females compared to noPTSS females. Avoidance behavior decreased across extinction trials but interactions with PTSS and gender fell short of significance. Overall, PTSD symptoms were associated with propensity to acquire and express avoidance behavior, in both civilians and veterans, and even in a cognitive task that does not explicitly involve trauma or fear. This effect was more pronounced in females, highlighting the role of gender differences in PTSD symptomatology. Importantly, this study also demonstrates the potential of an objective assessment of avoidance behavior, which could be used to supplement the common but limited self-report tools.

In some cases learning seems to happen all at once. Limited prior research on these “epiphanies” has shown evidence of sudden changes in behavior, but it remains unclear how such epiphanies occur. We propose a sequential-sampling model of epiphany learning (EL) and test it using an eye-tracking experiment. In the experiment, subjects repeatedly play a strategic game that has an optimal strategy. Subjects can learn over time from feedback but are also allowed to commit to a strategy at any time, eliminating all other options and opportunities to learn. We find that the EL model is consistent with the choices, eye movements, and pupillary responses of subjects who commit to the optimal strategy (correct epiphany) but not always of those who commit to a suboptimal strategy or who do not commit at all. Our findings suggest that EL is driven by a latent evidence accumulation process that can be revealed with eye-tracking data.

The majority can track the beat of music and move along with it. These abilities are meaningful from a cognitive standpoint given their tight links with prominent motor and cognitive functions such as language and memory. When rhythmic skills are challenged by brain damage or neurodevelopmental disorders, remediation strategies based on rhythm can be considered. For example, rhythmic training can be used to improve motor performance (e.g., gait) as well as cognitive and language skills. Here, we review the games readily available in the market and assess whether they are well-suited for rhythmic training. Games that train rhythm skills may serve as useful tools for retraining motor and cognitive functions in patients with motor or neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, dyslexia, or ADHD). Our criteria were the peripheral used to capture and record the response, the type of response and the output measure. None of the existing games provides sufficient temporal precision in stimulus presentation and/or data acquisition. In addition, games do not train selectively rhythmic skills. Hence, the available music games, in their present form, are not satisfying for training rhythmic skills. Yet, some features such as the device used, the interface or the game scenario provide good indications for devising efficient training protocols. Guidelines are provided for devising serious music games targeting rhythmic training in the future.

As part of a 21-day diary study, community-dwelling middle-aged women ( N = 103; age range 40–60 years) wore an accelerometer for the objective assessment of physical activity and completed daily Internet surveys at the end of their day. Multilevel analyses indicated the between-person effects of physical activity on SWL were negligent but that on days when a woman was more physically active than her usual, she reported greater SWL ( B = 12.01, p < .05). Sedentary behavior did not demonstrate a between- or within-person association with SWL. Women also experienced reduced SWL on days when greater symptom burden was reported ( B = −2.47, p < .05). Neuroticism also emerged as a top-down personality trait with a negative relation to SWL ( B = −1.47, p < .05). Higher levels of neuroticism predicted reduced daily life satisfaction particularly on days characterized by heightened symptom burden ( B = −0.26, p < .05).

In education, students frequently use the WWW for selecting information to accomplish assignments such as writing an essay or preparing a presentation. The evaluation of sources and information is an important sub‐skill in this process. But many students have not yet optimally developed this skill. On the basis of verbal reports, eye‐tracking data and navigation logs, this study investigated how novices in the domain of psychology evaluate Internet sources as compared to domain experts. In addition, two different verbal reporting techniques, namely thinking aloud and cued retrospective reporting, were compared in order to examine students' evaluation behaviour. Results revealed that domain expertise has an impact on individuals' evaluation behaviour during Web search, such that domain experts showed a more sophisticated use of evaluation criteria to judge the reliability of sources and information and selected more reliable information than domain novices. Furthermore, the different verbal reporting techniques did not lead to different conclusions on criteria use in relation to domain expertise, although in general more utterances concerning evaluation of sources and information were expressed during cued retrospective reporting.

Procedural generation of user-tailored content increases the self-motivation of players as they immerse themselves in the virtual world. An adaptive user model is needed to capture the skills of the player and enable automatic game content altering algorithms to fit the individual user. We propose an adaptive user modelling approach using a combination of unobtrusive physiological data to identify strengths and weaknesses in user performance in car racing games. Our system creates user-tailored tracks to improve driving habits and user experience, and to keep engagement at high levels. The user modelling approach adopts concepts from the Trace Theory framework; it uses machine learning to extract features from the user’s physiological data and game-related actions, and cluster them into low level primitives. These primitives are transformed and evaluated into higher level abstractions such as  experience, exploration and attention. These abstractions are subsequently used to provide track alteration decisions for the player. Collection of data and feedback from 52 users allowed us to associate key model variables and outcomes to user responses, and to verify that the model provides statistically significant decisions personalised to the individual player. Tailored game content variations between users in our experiments, as well as the correlations with user satisfaction demonstrate that our algorithm is able to automatically incorporate user feedback in subsequent procedural content generation.

All versions of this article have been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-60840-001.) This article describes the development and psychometric properties of the Secondary Traumatic Stress Informed Organizational Assessment (STSI-OA), a 40-item instrument designed to evaluate the degree to which an organization is STS-informed and able to respond to the impact of secondary traumatic stress in the workplace. A sample of 629 respondents representing multiple systems of care, job roles, and functions completed the STSI-OA. Analyses revealed a 5 factor structure that explained a large proportion of variance, excellent internal consistency, good test–retest reliability, and concurrent criterion validity with the Trauma System Readiness Tool Vicarious Trauma domain. Quartile scores and means were calculated to allow for comparisons. Based on the results of this analysis, it appears the STSI-OA total and domain scores can be used to create a blueprint for organizational learning, and to reliably track progress toward desired change over time.

This paper has two goals. The first goal is to investigate the basic claims of the proposed Two-System Framework for Game-Based Learning (or 2SM) (Martinez-Garza & Clark, 2016) that may serve as part of a general-use explanatory framework for educational gaming. The second goal is to explore and demonstrate the use of automatically collected log files of student play as evidence through educational data mining techniques. These techniques could also find general use, and this paper offers a demonstration of plausible methods and processes that are suited for game play data. These goals were pursued via two research questions. The first research question examines whether students playing The Fuzzy Chronicles showed evidence of dichotomous fast/slow modes of solution. The 2SM theorizes that slow modes of solution will correlate to higher learning gains. Congruent with the 2SM, students who use mainly fast iterative solution strategies achieved lower learning gains than students who preferred slow, elaborate solutions, or a more balanced mix of the two. A second research question investigates the connection between conceptual understanding and student performance in conceptually-laden challenges. The finding was that students generally improve their performance in these challenges as gameplay progresses, but that this improvement is strongly moderated by their prior knowledge of physics. Implications of these findings in terms of educational game design, analysis of gameplay logs, and further refinement of the 2SM are discussed.

In recent studies, reconstruction of speech from single-trial electroencephalogram (EEG) data has been used to decode which talker a listener is attending to in a two-talker situation. It is currently unclear how this generalizes to more complex sound environments. Behaviorally, speech perception is robust to the acoustic distortions that listeners typically encounter in everyday life, but it is unknown whether this is mirrored by a noise-robust neural tracking of attended speech. Here we used advanced acoustic simulations to recreate real-world acoustic scenes in the laboratory. In virtual acoustic realities with varying amounts of reverberation and number of interfering talkers, listeners selectively attended to the speech stream of a particular talker. Across the different listening environments, we found that the attended talker could be accurately decoded from single-trial EEG data irrespective of the different distortions in the acoustic input. For highly reverberant environments, speech envelopes reconstructed from neural responses to the distorted stimuli resembled the original clean signal more than the distorted input. With reverberant speech, we observed a late cortical response to the attended speech stream that encoded temporal modulations in the speech signal without its reverberant distortion. Single-trial attention decoding accuracies based on 40–50s long blocks of data from 64 scalp electrodes were equally high (80–90% correct) in all considered listening environments and remained statistically significant using down to 10 scalp electrodes and short (<30-s) unaveraged EEG segments. In contrast to the robust decoding of the attended talker we found that decoding of the unattended talker deteriorated with the acoustic distortions. These results suggest that cortical activity tracks an attended speech signal in a way that is invariant to acoustic distortions encountered in real-life sound environments. Noise-robust attention decoding additionally suggests a potential utility of stimulus reconstruction techniques in attention-controlled brain-computer interfaces.

According to our online survey, 79.30% of the respondents reported experiencing orientation errors during document capture. In addition, our lab study showed that more than 90% of landscape capture tasks result in incorrect orientation. To solve this problem, we systematically analyzed the user behavior during document capture (e.g., video sequences and photographs taken or hand grip used) and propose a novel solution called ScanShot, which detects document capture time to help users correct orientation errors. ScanShot tracks the direction of gravity during document capture and monitors the users rotational or tilting movements of to update changes in orientation automatically. Our results confirm that document capture with 93.44% accuracy; in addition, our orientation update mechanism can reduce orientation errors by 92.85% using a gyroscope (for rotation) and 81.60% using an accelerometer (for micro-tilts).

Methods: This study recruited 105 chronic pain patients to use a smartphone pain app and half of the patients (N = 52) had 2-way messaging available through the app. All patients completed baseline measures and were asked to record their progress every day for 3 months, with the opportunity to continue for 6 months. All participants were supplied a Fitbit to track daily activity. Summary line graphs were posted to each of the patients’ electronic medical records and physicians were notified of their patient’s progress. Results: Ninety patients successfully downloaded the pain app. Average age of the participants was 47.1 (range, 18 to 72), 63.8% were female and 32.3% reported multiple pain sites. Adequate validity and reliability was found between the daily assessments and standardized questionnaires ( r = 0.50) and in repeated daily measures (pain, r = 0.69; sleep, r = 0.83). The app was found to be easily introduced and well tolerated. Those patients assigned to the 2-way messaging condition on average tended to use the app more and submit more daily assessments (95.6 vs. 71.6 entries), but differences between groups were not significant. Pain-app satisfaction ratings overall were high. Discussion: This study highlights some of the challenges and benefits in utilizing smartphone apps to manage chronic pain patients, and provides insight into those individuals who might benefit from mHealth technology.

The automated scoring and feedback technology was integrated into an online module. Students’ written scientific argumentation occurred when they responded to structured argumentation prompts. After submitting the open-ended responses, students received scores generated by a scoring engine and written feedback associated with the scores in real-time. Using the log data that recorded argumentation scores as well as argument submission and revisions activities, we answer three research questions. First, how students behaved after receiving the feedback; second, whether and how students’ revisions improved their argumentation scores; and third, did item difficulties shift with the availability of the automated feedback. Results showed that the majority of students (77%) made revisions after receiving the feedback, and students with higher initial scores were more likely to revise their responses.

However, the environment is changing increasingly quickly, creating new challenges and opportunities. This article argues that, in this new context, human memory limitations lead to inaccurate results when using surveys in order to study objective online behavior: People cannot recall everything they did. It therefore investigates the possibility of using, in addition to survey data, passive data from a tracking application (called a ""meter"") installed on participants’ devices to register their online behavior. After evaluating the extent of some of the main drawbacks linked to passive data collection with a case study (Netquest metered panel in Spain), this article shows that the data from the web survey and the meter lead to very different results about the online behavior of the same sample of respondents, showing the need to combine several sources of data collection in the future.

We combine mobile log data and a mobile panel survey, and examine two stages in mobile shopping: the possession of shopping applications (hereafter, apps) and the purchase via shopping apps. Our exploratory investigation of mobile data and its empirical analyses provide three substantive findings. First, online experience and mobile experience both positively relate to the possession of shopping apps. Second, browsing behavior for non-shopping apps helps understand the possession of shopping apps as it reflects user preferences for acquiring more apps. Third, purchasing decisions are explained by digital experience (i.e., online experience and mobile experience) and browsing information from shopping apps, with other factors being of little predictive value. The implications for mobile retailing research and practice are discussed.

Although the communication history is usually accessible to the participants in the environment, it is time consuming for them to process the communication data because of the large volume of messages. These characteristics make it difficult for one to keep track of, identify, and interpret the others’ ideas, opinions, and their rationales in LSOOP activities. We argue for a computational approach that automatically identifies and extracts the rationales from LSOOP communication data and presents them to the participants through rationale-based awareness tools. In this paper we bring together different and hitherto independent lines of research, and propose to use them in a conceptual framework integrating three analytical aspects related to the detection of rationales: linguistic, informational, and argumentative and communicative.

Misunderstanding over how real-world teachers maintain behavioral charts may cause miscommunication between the teacher and the school psychologist. This study sought to determine how teachers collect and track behavioral data. Researchers examined behavioral charts used by teachers in a Title I elementary school that reported using Positive Behavioral Intervention Supports (PBIS). Researchers evaluated charts for ten classrooms (~150 students) and compared the type of data collected by each teacher for each child. Findings indicated that teachers either used no system, their own systems, or a computer-based system (Class Dojo) for charting behavior. An analysis of each of these systems found that Class Dojo provided significantly more data (positive and negative notations) in general, as well as more reliable data than any other system reviewed. Discussions of these findings within a PBIS framework, as well as general concerns about the computer-based system, are provided.

In the original article, some of the members of the Track Investigator list were not listed in the appendix. This correction has been made in the online version as of June 28, 2017.] Background: Huntington's disease is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene, HTT. Age at onset has been used as a quantitative phenotype in genetic analysis looking for Huntington's disease modifiers, but is hard to define and not always available. Therefore, we aimed to generate a novel measure of disease progression and to identify genetic markers associated with this progression measure. Methods: We generated a progression score on the basis of principal component analysis of prospectively acquired longitudinal changes in motor, cognitive, and imaging measures in the 218 indivduals in the TRACK-HD cohort of Huntington's disease gene mutation carriers (data collected 2008–11). We generated a parallel progression score using data from 1773 previously genotyped participants from the European Huntington's Disease Network REGISTRY study of Huntington's disease mutation carriers (data collected 2003–13). We did a genome-wide association analyses in terms of progression for 216 TRACK-HD participants and 1773 REGISTRY participants, then a meta-analysis of these results was undertaken. Findings: Longitudinal motor, cognitive, and imaging scores were correlated with each other in TRACK-HD participants, justifying use of a single, cross-domain measure of disease progression in both studies. The TRACK-HD and REGISTRY progression measures were correlated with each other (r = 0·674), and with age at onset (TRACK-HD, r = 0·315; REGISTRY, r = 0·234). The meta-analysis of progression in TRACK-HD and REGISTRY gave a genome-wide significant signal (p = 1·12 × 10 −10) on chromosome 5 spanning three genes: MSH3, DHFR, and MTRNR2L2. The genes in this locus were associated with progression in TRACK-HD ( MSH3 p = 2·94 × 10 −8 DHFR p = 8·37 × 10 −7 MTRNR2L2 p = 2·15 × 10 −9) and to a lesser extent in REGISTRY ( MSH3 p = 9·36 × 10 −4 DHFR p = 8·45 × 10 −4 MTRNR2L2 p = 1·20 × 10 −3). The lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TRACK-HD (rs557874766) was genome-wide significant in the meta-analysis (p =1·58 × 10 −8), and encodes an aminoacid change (Pro67Ala) in MSH3. In TRACK-HD, each copy of the minor allele at this SNP was associated with a 0·4 units per year (95% CI 0·16–0·66) reduction in the rate of change of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Total Motor Score, and a reduction of 0·12 units per year (95% CI 0·06–0·18) in the rate of change of UHDRS Total Functional Capacity score. These associations remained significant after adjusting for age of onset. Interpretation: The multidomain progression measure in TRACK-HD was associated with a functional variant that was genome-wide significant in our meta-analysis. The association in only 216 participants implies that the progression measure is a sensitive reflection of disease burden, that the effect size at this locus is large, or both. Knockout of Msh3 reduces somatic expansion in Huntington's disease mouse models, suggesting this mechanism as an area for future therapeutic investigation.

While other studies explore engagement in communities where citizens contribute data, the current research investigates a community to support citizens in facilitating their own scientific investigations. Data were collected from log files and questionnaires, and multiple measures of engagement were examined: engagement metrics, roles, motivation, attitude, satisfaction and belonging to the community. The results allowed comparison of the engagement levels among different types of citizen participation communities and categorised members in engagement profiles, according to their behaviour patterns.

The lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TRACK-HD (rs557874766) was genome-wide significant in the meta-analysis (p =1·58 × 10 −8), and encodes an aminoacid change (Pro67Ala) in MSH3. In TRACK-HD, each copy of the minor allele at this SNP was associated with a 0·4 units per year (95% CI 0·16–0·66) reduction in the rate of change of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Total Motor Score, and a reduction of 0·12 units per year (95% CI 0·06–0·18) in the rate of change of UHDRS Total Functional Capacity score. These associations remained significant after adjusting for age of onset. Interpretation: The multidomain progression measure in TRACK-HD was associated with a functional variant that was genome-wide significant in our meta-analysis. The association in only 216 participants implies that the progression measure is a sensitive reflection of disease burden, that the effect size at this locus is large, or both. Knockout of Msh3 reduces somatic expansion in Huntington's disease mouse models, suggesting this mechanism as an area for future therapeutic investigation.

To address vaccine hesitancy in Washington State, a public–private partnership of health organizations implemented and evaluated a 3-year community intervention, called the “Immunity Community.” The intervention mobilized parents who value immunization and provided them with tools to engage in positive dialogue about immunizations in their communities. The evaluation used qualitative and quantitative methods, including focus groups, interviews, and pre and post online surveys of parents, to assess perceptions about and reactions to the intervention, assess facilitators and barriers to success, and track outcomes including parental knowledge and attitudes. The program successfully engaged parent volunteers to be immunization advocates. Surveys of parents in the intervention communities showed statistically significant improvements in vaccine-related attitudes: The percentage concerned about other parents not vaccinating their children increased from 81.2% to 88.6%, and the percentage reporting themselves as “vaccine-hesitant” decreased from 22.6% to 14.0%. There were not statistically significant changes in parental behaviors. This study demonstrates the promise of using parent advocates as part of a community-based approach to reduce vaccine hesitancy.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the differences between objective and subjective gambling spent data by comparing gambler’s actual behavioral tracking data with their self-report data over a 1-month period. A total of 17,742 Norwegian online gamblers were asked to participate in an online survey. Of those surveyed, 1335 gamblers answered questions relating to gambling expenditure that could be compared with their actual gambling behavior. The study found that the estimated loss self-reported by gamblers was correlated with the actual objective loss and that players with higher losses tended to have more difficulty estimating their gambling expenditure (i.e., players who spent more money gambling also appeared to have more trouble estimating their expenses accurately). Overall, the findings demonstrate that caution is warranted when using self-report data relating to amount of money spent gambling in any studies that are totally reliant on self-report data.

We find evidence in both data sources that, on average, women faculty perform significantly more service than men, controlling for rank, race/ethnicity, and field or department. Our analyses suggest that the male–female differential is driven more by internal service—i.e., service to the university, campus, or department—than external service—i.e., service to the local, national, and international communities—although significant heterogeneity exists across field and discipline in the way gender differentials play out.

To address this public health need many states have adopted collaborative care programs to assist primary care to better assess and manage pediatric mental health concerns. This report adds to the small literature on collaborative care programs and describes one large program that covers most of New York state. Program description: CAP PC, a component program of New York State's Office of Mental Health (OMH) Project TEACH, has provided education and consultation support to primary care providers covering most of New York state since 2010. The program is uniquely a five medical school collaboration with hubs at each that share one toll free number and work together to provide education and consultation support services to PCPs. Methods: The program developed a clinical communications record to track information about all consultations which forms the basis of much of this report. 2-week surveys following consultations, annual surveys, and pre- and post-educational program evaluations have also been used to measure the success of the program. Results: CAP PC has grown over the 6 years of the program and has provided 8013 phone consultations to over 1500 PCPs. The program synergistically provided 17,523 CME credits of educational programming to 1200 PCPs. PCP users of the program report very high levels of satisfaction and self reported growth in confidence. Conclusions: CAP PC demonstrates that large-scale collaborative consultation models for primary care are feasible to implement, popular with PCPs, and can be sustained. The program supports increased access to child mental health services in primary care and provides child psychiatric expertise for patients who would otherwise have none.

The behaviour of gamblers has been extensively studied and much has been published on the subject. The vast majority of research has relied on self-reported gambling behaviour or case study research. With the advent of the Internet, however, it has become possible for researchers to remotely study the real behaviour of gamblers. The goal has been to empirically describe playing behaviour in several conditions and contexts. Existing research, conducted since the 2000s, focuses on several forms of gambling such as sports betting, casino, poker, and lottery, but there is still only a concise body of research on gambling behaviour with the use of Internet gambling tracking data. Most studies are based on the same databases, meaning that a few companies and websites were the basis for most of the research produced so far. It is important to explore new sources of information, methodologies, and approaches to enrich discussion and contribute to a better understanding of this field. The empirical analysis of gambling behaviour with the use of tracking data was found to greatly contribute to the understanding of player behaviour, despite existing limitations and problems. Considering that Internet gambling behavioural tracking is still a fairly recent phenomenon, much can still be done to further develop this field of research.

Here, we used a high-technology system (COGNIFOOT) which combines a visual environment simulator fully synchronized with a motion capture system. This system allowed us to measure objective real-time CMP parameters (passing accuracy/speed and response times) in a large turf-artificial grass playfield. Forty-six (46) young elite soccer players (including 2 female players) aged between 11 and 16 years who belonged to the same youth soccer academy were tested. Each player had to pass the ball as fast and as accurately as possible towards visual targets projected onto a large screen located 5.32 meters in front of him (a short pass situation). We observed a linear age-related increase in the CMP: the passing accuracy, speed and reactiveness of players improved by 4 centimeters, 2.3 km/h and 30 milliseconds per year of age, respectively. These data were converted into 5 point-scales and compared to the judgement of expert coaches, who also used a 5 point-scale to evaluate the same CMP parameters but based on their experience with the players during games and training. The objectively-measured age-related CMP changes were also observed in expert coaches' judgments although these were more variable across coaches and age categories. This demonstrates that high-technology systems like COGNIFOOT can be used in complement to traditional approaches of talent identification and to objectively monitor the progress of soccer players throughout a cognitive-motor training cycle.

This study aims to contribute towards deeper understanding the examinee’s time-spent and achievement behavior during testing according to the five personality traits by exploiting assessment analytics. Further, it aims to investigate assessment analytics appropriateness for classifying students and generating enhanced student models to guide personalization of testing services. In this study, the LAERS assessment environment and the Big Five Inventory were used to track the response times of 112 undergraduate students and to extract their personality traits respectively. Partial Least Squares was used to detect fundamental relationships between the collected data, and Supervised Learning Algorithms were used to classify students. Results indicate a positive effect of extraversion and agreeableness on goal-expectancy, a positive effect of conscientiousness on both goal-expectancy and level of certainty, and a negative effect of neuroticism and openness on level of certainty. Further, extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness have statistically significant indirect impact on students’ response-times and level of achievement. Moreover, the ensemble RandomForest method provides accurate classification results, indicating that a time-spent driven description of students’ behavior could have added value towards dynamically reshaping the respective models.

Between-persons, participants with greater needs can receive more intense support, within-persons, participants can adjust utilization to their current level of symptoms. The purpose of the present study was to analyze associations between ED-related symptoms and utilization of the individualized program  ProYouth both between- and within-persons, aiming to investigate whether participants adapt utilization intensity to their current needs. Method: Generalized estimated equations (GEEs) were used to analyze log data on program utilization (monthly page visits, monthly use of chats and forum) assessed via server logs and self-reported data on ED-related symptoms from N = 394 ProYouth participants who provided longitudinal data for at least two months. Results: Between-persons, page visits per month were significantly associated with compensatory behavior, body dissatisfaction, and binge eating. Monthly use of the more intense modules with personal support chat and forum was associated with the frequency of compensatory behavior. Within-persons, unbalanced nutrition and dieting showed the strongest associations with monthly page visits. Monthly use of chats and forum was significantly associated with compensatory behavior and unbalanced nutrition and dieting. Discussion: Results indicate that program utilization is associated with ED-related symptoms between- as well as within-persons. The individualized, flexible approach of ProYouth thus seems to be a promising way for Internet-based provision of combined prevention and early intervention programs addressing ED.

Methods: Cross-sectional findings are based on 100 early years children (43.4 ± 9.4 months; 53% female) from Edmonton, Canada that were part of the Physical Activity and Cognition in Early Childhood (PACE) study. Sedentary time and physical activity (light-intensity, moderate- to vigorous-intensity, total) were objectively measured with an accelerometer. Sedentary behavior (television, video/computer games, screen time) and physical activity (organized, non-organized, total) were also subjectively measured with a parental questionnaire. Vocabulary was measured with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Fourth Edition, working memory was measured with the Nebraska Barnyard task, and response inhibition was measured with the Fish-Shark Go/No-Go task. Correlations and linear regression were used to examine associations. Results: Total subjective physical activity (r = 0.31; p = 0.018) and non-organized physical activity (r = 0.27; p = 0.035) were significantly positively correlated with vocabulary. Conversely, television viewing (r = −0.21; p = 0.046) was significantly negatively correlated with vocabulary. These significant associations remained in linear regression models after adjusting for age. Objectively measured sedentary time and physical activity were not significantly associated with any cognitive development measure and no sedentary behavior or physical activity measure was associated with working memory or response inhibition. Conclusions: Television viewing may be detrimental and physical activity, especially non-organized, may be beneficial for vocabulary in early years children. Future research with larger sample sizes and longitudinal and experimental study designs are needed to confirm these findings and determine the mechanisms.

In this article, we document the retention-related successes and failures of a longitudinal, social network-based study of active and desisting street gang members in Philadelphia, PA, and the District of Columbia. A purposive sample was used to identify and track 229 gang members at three points in time over 2 years to explore how the social networks of gang members change. Although gang members have many factors in common with other hidden populations, their criminal behavior and involvement with the justice system, coupled with the sensitivity of the social network survey questions for this study, created hurdles to maintaining research contact over time. With continued and systematic documentation of successes and challenges, academics can build an extensive backdrop from which to continue to study gang youth. If the field cannot devise cost-effective and transferable ways to study gangs beyond single-gang ethnographies, it will limit its understanding of important processes related to gang behavior, including gang joining and desistance.

This research has typically prescribed the exercise intensity and used one exercise mode. The aim of this study was to compare self-selected exercise intensity on a cycle ergometer with and without exergaming modes activated. A total of 20 participants aged between 18−40 years ( M = 24.2 ± 5.9) completed a sub-maximal exercise test. Participants returned two days later to complete one 45 minute session of self-selected exercise with 15 minutes in each of 'control' (standard ergometer), 'track', and 'game' modes, with order randomized. Heart rate, work rate, perceived exertion, and affective valence were recorded during exercise. Dissociation and enjoyment were recorded in the rest interval between each mode. Participants exercised above ventilatory threshold (VT) in all three modes (track, M = 9.5 ± 12%; game, M = 6.2 ± 12%; and control, M = 4.4 ± 14% above VT) and at higher work rates ( P < 0.05) exergaming (track, M = 94.5 ± 27.9; game, M = 96.2 ± 32.8 watts) than control ( M = 86.6 ± 26.5 watts). Despite exercising at a higher intensity, participants perceived exercise during the exergaming modes to be most pleasant ( P < 0.01), with greater enjoyment ( P < 0.01) and dissociation ( P < 0.01) in the game than track mode, and both modes higher on these variables than the control mode. Findings support the use of exergaming as a strategy to encourage individuals to exercise, with participants choosing to work harder physiologically, but reporting more positive psychological responses during and following the exercise.

Recent evidence indicates that social network use (e.g., Facebook) can serve as a chronic stressor to some users and contribute to poor health, however, mechanisms underlying these interactions remain unclear. In the current study we investigated if Facebook user behavior might help start to explain interactions between Facebook use, stress and health. In this prospective study, healthy college students completed online questionnaires assessing Facebook use, health and then were followed for 10 weeks to track incidence of upper respiratory infection (URI). Subjects who reported that Facebook provoked anxiety/stress demonstrated a significantly higher number of URI than those not reporting Facebook-induced anxiety/stress and having more Facebook friends was associated with increased anxiety/stress and the number of URI. Users who demonstrated anxiety regarding their Facebook use were more likely to demonstrate a pattern of increased number of log-ins to Facebook/day and these anxiety-linked behavior patterns were associated with poorer health. The other health practices and psychological processes assessed (e.g., physical activity levels, sleep, social support) do not appear to explain these associations. These results suggest an association between specific Facebook use, psychological anxiety and health might exist.

Most commonly delivered via smartphone, EMA and EMI have potential to provide simple, cost-effective, and userled treatment for psychotic disorders. This systematic review aimed to synthesize current research exploring the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of EMA and EMI in the treatment of psychotic disorders. Methods: A systematic search was conducted identifying studies published between 1980 and July 7, 2016, by searching PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials with combinations of search terms related to mobile devices, EMA and EMI, and psychotic disorders. Results: Of 1,623 studies identified, nine met inclusion criteria for the review. These studies found satisfactory feasibility and acceptability and preliminary evidence of improved clinical outcomes. The interventions, which had a broad array of features, targeted remote monitoring of illness and symptoms, and they also targeted illness self-management by using momentary reminders or instructions for behaviors, including medication adherence, management of symptoms and psychosocial impairments, daily living skills, and goal achievement. Conclusions: The findings of this review provide preliminary support for the clinical utility of EMA and EMI in the treatment of psychotic disorders. Future research should explore further applications of these technologies with larger sample sizes and controlled designs.

On the one hand, spending time on social networks could facilitate social discovery, meaning that consumers “discover” or “stumble upon” products through their connections with others. Moreover, cumulative social network use could expose consumers to new shopping-related information, possibly with greater marginal value than the incremental time spent on a shopping website. This process may therefore be associated with increased shopping activity. On the other hand, social network use could be a substitute for other online activities, including shopping. To test the relationship between social network use and online shopping, the authors leverage a unique consumer panel data set that tracks people’s browsing of shopping and social network websites and their online purchasing activities over one year. The authors find that greater cumulative usage of social networking sites is positively associated with shopping activity. However, they also find a short-term negative relationship, such that immediately after a period of increased usage of social networking sites, online shopping activity appears to be lower.

Results revealed that all three groups utilized a variety of resources daily, but with some noticeable differences. For instance, (1) teachers and teacher candidates used the Internet on school devices much more than students; (2) they accessed general, multimedia, search, entertainment, shopping and social resources at a higher rate than students; (3) students visited a higher proportion of educational websites than their teachers; and (4) teachers visited a higher proportion of search pages than teacher candidates.

There are now streaming services that store data from millions of people on their day-to-day musical listening habits; song-level data that tags sonic and emotion attributes for millions of songs; wearable devices (e.g. watches and earbuds) that capture physiological metrics including heartrate and galvanic skin response; mobile technologies that track a person's moment-to-moment activity, location, mood, and sociability; and survey instruments and digital footprints that capture personality and other biopsychosocial metrics in just under a minute. We propose that merging these technologies can create a new age in music psychology that exponentially expands the present knowledge and scope of the field. The new data will advance general areas of music psychology, but will also provide an important opportunity to establish new knowledge about health and well-being that can have a direct impact on the public. By scientifically mapping how music changes behavior and health in the short-term and long-term, Big Music Data can lead to future health initiatives including the development of new evidence-based treatment modalities to be utilized by medical physicians and mental health practitioners. Importantly, industry and streaming services can use these new insights to optimize their technologies and develop music-based health and wellness platforms aimed at improving the well-being of its users, ultimately impacting the way music is used by millions of people globally.

Through in-depth examinations of Sesame Street, the 1977 Roots miniseries, and the public culture that surrounded these shows, I demonstrate that the feelings of viewers were the central object of intervention in this racial project. Both shows attempted to instill self-esteem and pride among Black viewers while stimulating feelings of sympathy or identification among White viewers with the people of color represented on their programs. Commentators and viewers responded enthusiastically to this approach, expressing tremendous optimism that the emotional changes wrought through viewing these programs would indeed ameliorate racial inequality between Blacks and Whites. Although this approach to ameliorating racism did not achieve its overall goal, the notion that race is no longer a major factor in determining life chances has become the dominant racial ideology in the United States today. Drawing upon Eduardo Bonilla-Silva's theorization of this ideology, which he terms colorblind racism, I show how the efforts to end inequality by changing people's feelings through television entertainment contributed to the emergence of this transformed racism. This dissertation traces a discourse on feelings through production documents, newspaper and magazine articles, government reports, memoirs, archived interviews, and the shows themselves. My investigation demonstrates that much public discourse from the late 1960s through the 1970s circulated around emotions said to contribute to or combat racial inequality. This idea shaped the work of the television professionals behind Sesame Street and Roots, who further promoted the idea that cultivating the right feelings meant ending racism and racial inequality. Asking individuals to conduct emotional restructurings as a way to undo the effects of the nation's racial history---through viewing particular media products, for example---directs attention away from needed institutional change while also reinforcing the liberal value of individualism. It made colorblind racism possible by providing a framework for equating the end of racism with the emergence of Black pride and the minimization of conscious racial hatred by Whites. Moreover, this reasoning provided an avenue for expressing and pursuing desires to end racism that would not challenge the educational, economic, and legal institutions that reproduce racial inequality.

"SAKAGUJD","thesis","2018","Vandrevala, Cyrus M.","The development of a computerized interactive teaching assistant in physics: The CITA on CHIP project","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1945235040?accountid=14026","One of the many roles of university instructors is to provide help to students throughout the semester - especially in the form of feedback on homework. Personalized feedback from the instructor might be possible in a small classroom setting, but becomes unmanageable when class sizes grow to dozens or even hundreds of students. As a result, universities are turning to computerized homework systems that guide students through problems and provide focused grades and feedback. The overarching goal of this project was to design a comprehensive, scaffolded set of tutorials for the homework questions in an undergraduate electricity and magnetism course for engineering majors and determine how the tutorials affected student performance. The research group developed CITA (Computerized Interactive Teaching Assistant) using a design-based research approach. This system assessed student knowledge and provided focused feedback using three structures - Shallow CITA, Immersive CITA, and Postscripts. Throughout the semester, I collected student grade data as well as student opinions of the CITA system through surveys and focus group interviews. The analysis of data informed an iterative development process. This study aimed to answer a few research questions. First, does the use of CITA tutorials improve student performance in their introductory electricity and magnetism course? Second, what are students’ views of the CITA program? Finally, what motivates students to choose CITA over some other external educational resource? Overall, the first version of CITA showed no gains in student performance in the summer of 2015. However, versions two and three of CITA showed small but statistically significant gains for students that used the system. This is especially apparent in the spring 2016 semester. Students who used versions two and three of CITA generally had positive things to say about the system. Surveys questions based on Likert scales along with open-response questions and focus group interviews all indicate that students found Shallow CITA particularly helpful and Immersive CITA helpful under most circumstances. However, students generally did not find the Postscripts helpful or worthwhile. Finally, I conducted a step-by-step analysis of the tutorials that were used in the CITA system in order to track student retention. These results were synthesized with student responses from focus group interviews to gain an understanding of what motivates students to use CITA tutorials over other external resources (e.g. Google, Yahoo Answers, the course textbook, etc.). Since students were able to choose between CITA and other external resources, they adopted strategies to efficiently solve homework problems rather than maximize learning. Students left a CITA tutorial if they encountered a step which was perceived as tedious. Thus, online tutorials must be designed to prevent students from prematurely leaving the tutorial system.

Eleven teachers of Spanish to middle-school students created transmedia materials containing QR codes linking to audio resources. Students accessed the audio tracks by scanning the QR code with an application on a smartphone while completing a homework task. The teachers assigned two tasks in a systems approach model: first a formative, and then a revised summative trial. After each attempt, the Spanish teachers shared their experiences of creating and using the transmedia materials by participating in interviews. Data was collected by means of a needs analysis survey, recordings and transcription of the two interviews, and by obtaining copies of the transmedia materials. The data analysis included a content analysis of the coded interviews, the results of which were triangulated with the responses collected in the needs analysis survey and an examination of the teacher-created materials. Several benefits to using audio QR codes were identified as a result of the analyses. These include the minimal amount of time and expertise required for teachers to create the transmedia materials, an increased student exposure to audio-only materials to aid listening comprehension, and the way in which the use of this technique allowed for transformative learning activities and a conservation of instructional minutes in the classroom. Some barriers were also noted, the largest being that device ownership and Internet access were not universal among students. Additionally, parental restrictions on smartphone use and some school administration polices regarding personal devices made the practice of using mobile technology for homework tasks difficult in certain cases. Implications include the possibility that training pre-service and in-service teachers in the use of transmedia materials that link to audio-only content may help decrease students' cognitive load and lead to an increase in foreign language learners' listening comprehension skills. Further study in the use of transmedia materials and mobile technology to support foreign language learning is recommended.

"XN4EF4VV","thesis","2018","Xie, Kun","New opportunities in urban safety analytics using advanced quantitative methods and big data","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1952959362?accountid=14026","Quantitative methods have been used in the last few decades to explore safety-related data and to provide critical inferences to essential tasks of road safety management such as investigation of risk factors, before-after safety evaluation and hotspot identification. There have been steady advances in quantitative methodologies over time, which can help discover new knowledge from data sources available. Case study I proposes an improved modeling approach that involves the use of the multivariate conditional autoregressive (CAR) model integrated with site-specific random parameters. The proposed model is found to outperform conventional models which are developed as comparisons. Weighted ""potential for safety improvement"" (WPSI), which can account for both the injury severity and effects of exposure indicators, is proposed for hotspot identification. WPSI could be captured more accurately based on the proposed model since that crash counts at different injury severity levels are jointly modeled, the site-specific spatial effects are properly estimated, and varying effects of certain explanatory variables are considered by incorporating random parameters. Case study II aims to explore the potential of using big data in advancing the pedestrian risk analysis including the investigation of contributing factors and hotspot identification. Massive amounts of data obtained from a variety of sources in Manhattan are collected, integrated and processed. These datasets include individual taxi trips, subway turnstile counts, traffic volumes, road network characteristics, land use, socio-demographic and social media data. The whole study area is uniformly split into grid cells as the basic geographical unit of analysis. The cell-structured framework makes it easy to incorporate rich and diversified data into the risk analysis. The cost of each crash, weighted by injury severity, is assigned to the cells based on the relative distance to the crash site using a kernel density function. Case study III proposes an alternative approach that makes use of traffic conflicts extracted from traffic video recordings for safety assessment, instead of historical crash data used in most of the previous safety studies. State-of-the-art computer vision techniques developed by our research team are used to extract vehicle trajectories automatically from 70 hours of traffic video data at two intersections. More specifically, a modified implementation of the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) feature tracker is used to extract the feature points and track those feature points frame by frame. The spectral embedding and the Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM) are employed to cluster feature points that belong to the same object. The combination of each vehicle's individual trajectory with all the others' trajectories is screened to identify all the possible vehicle pairs involved in conflict risk. Traffic conflict risks are identified after the time to collision (TTC) is computed for each vehicle pair. Case study IV aims to evaluate the safety impacts of off-hour deliveries in Manhattan which are expected to shift a portion of trucks from the regular daytime hours to the nighttime off-hours. Truck crashes, traffic volumes and geometric design features of 256 road segments in Manhattan are collected to develop safety evaluation models. To accurately quantify the safety impacts of off-hour deliveries, an improved modeling approach is proposed that involve the use of the multivariate Poisson-lognormal model integrated with measurement errors in truck volumes. The results show that off-hour delivery programs are not expected to increase the overall risk of truck-involved crashes significantly.

Examinees' rapid-guessing and insufficient familiarity with computers have been found to be major issues that weaken the validity arguments of scores. This study has three goals: (a) improving methods to set and evaluate threshold values for detecting rapid-guessing, (b) comparing the response behaviors of examinees with high and low computer familiarity performed, and (c) understanding the potential relationships between computer familiarity, response processes, and scores. Data were drawn from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012. Specifically, the analysis of included Australian examinees' responses to ten released computer-based mathematics items, log data associated with these questions, and seven questions in the information and communications technology (ICT) questionnaire on using computers in schools for mathematical tasks. Response time based methods suggested by Kong, Wise, and Bhola (2007) were used for setting thresholds for identifying rapid-guessing. Enhanced methods were constructed by incorporating response time and number of response behaviors. Both response time based methods and enhanced methods were evaluated using Wise and Kong's (2005) criteria as well as number and type of response behaviors. To explore computer familiarity, response behaviors of examinees with low-computer familiarity and high-computer familiarity were compared, and correlations were calculated between computer-familiarity, response behaviors, and response times. Findings indicated that enhanced methods performed superior than the response time based methods on some of the evaluation criteria; examinees with low computer familiarity displayed some response behaviors more frequently than the examinees with high computer familiarity; and no association between computer familiarity, scores, number of response behaviors, and response time were found. This study concluded that using response times and response behaviors were useful for improving identifying rapid-guessing and exploring the potential role of low computer familiarity on examinees' testing processes and scores.

"Z43N4K35","thesis","2018","Scheckner, Bari","Investigating the role of parental social support, patient-provider relationships, and illness-related beliefs on childhood asthma outcomes","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1958352077?accountid=14026","Introduction: This study broadly aimed to expand our understanding of asthma disparities among PR and Mexican children by assessing the relationship between psychosocial factors and asthma outcomes. More specifically, the study assessed the impact of caregivers' social support from family and friends and caregivers' perceived relationships with healthcare providers on asthma control and controller medication adherence. Additionally, using the Common Sense Model (CSM) of Illness Representation as a theoretical framework, the impact of health-related beliefs and ethnic differences in such beliefs were investigated. Methods: Parent-child dyads (N=267) of Mexican and Puerto Rican (PR) descent participated in the study. Subjects were recruited from asthma clinics at two inner-city hospitals in Bronx, NY, two school-based health clinics in Phoenix, AZ, and a mobile asthma clinic in Phoenix, AZ. All children had a diagnosis of asthma. Measures included: Social Networks Questionnaire, Asthma Illness Representation Scale, and Asthma Control Test and Childhood Asthma Control Test. Adherence was calculated using electronic doser devices and TrackCaps attached to children's medications. Patients' use of controller medications was also assessed by comparing self-reported use to prescription records obtained through medical chart review. Results: Objectively measured adherence to controller medications was low in our sample (inhaled corticosteroids (ICS): M= 42.75% +/- 32.03%, leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA): M= 54.25% +/- 30.72%). Adherence was significantly associated with well-controlled asthma (p = .01). Patient-healthcare provider relationships also were significantly and positively related to asthma control, even after controlling for the effects of the child's gender and ethnicity (p = .005). However, adherence did not vary by ethnic group, although PR participants were significantly more likely than Mexicans to lose their dosers and/or medications. Participants' adherence to controller medications was not significantly related to social support (total support: p = .75, family support: p = .96, friend support: p = .59), caregivers' relationships with providers (p = .94), or illness representations (Nature of Symptoms: 9 = -.08,p = .46, Facts About Asthma: 9 = .19,p = .08, Attitudes Towards Anti-Inflammatory Medication: 9 = .14, p = .19, Treatment Expectations: 9 = .21,p = .06, Emotional Aspects of Medication: 9 = -.06,p = .59). Overall illness representations were found to be midway between the professional and lay models of health beliefs (AIRS Total Score: M = 3.08 +/- .35). Mexican caregivers were significantly more likely to have treatment expectations aligned with the professional model (M= 3.07 +/- .59) than PR caregivers (M= 2.76 +/- .451), p = .001. There were no between-group differences on overall illness representations or any of the other subscales. Illness representations were also positively and significantly related to caregivers' relationships with providers (AIRS Total Score: p < .001, Nature of Symptoms: r = .28,p < .001, Facts About Asthma: r = .44,p < .001, Attitudes Towards Anti-Inflammatory Medication: r = .37, p < .001, Treatment Expectations: r = .16,p <. 05, Emotional Aspects of Medication: r = .37,p < .001). Finally, illness representations were significantly related to asthma control, with children whose caregivers held professional illness beliefs being more likely to have well-controlled asthma (p < .001). There was no interaction effect between illness representation and ethnicity on asthma control. Conclusions: Implications of these results suggest that, in the sample studied, psychosocial factors (i.e., social support, relationships with providers, health-related beliefs) affect overall asthma control but not adherence to asthma controller medications.

"JAUMKVHB","thesis","2018","Magerko, Katherine A.","Healthy hearts in family child care: What is the current state of provider health?","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1960507871?accountid=14026","Family child care providers (FCCPs) are an important source of child care for close to 1.5 million children under the age of five (Laughlin, 2013). FCCPs provide care to children in their own homes and tend to be a source of care for lower income children. As child care has been identified as a risk factor for childhood obesity (Geoffroy et al., 2013), there have been a few efforts to create quality interventions targeting children in family child care (Mann et al., 2015; Trost, Messner, Fitzgerald, & Roths, 2011). However, little is known about the health of these providers (Gratz & Claffey, 1996). This is the first set of studies to look specifically at FCCP self-reported and objectively measured health. A modified double ABC-X model (McCubbin & Patterson, 1983) was used to examine FCCP cardiovascular risk and resilience processes. Study 1. FCCP health was compared to a matched sample from the same state using data from the Center for Disease Control (2014). Online and paper-based surveys were utilized to form an analytic sample of 165 FCCPs. SPSS v23 was used to calculate descriptives, chi-square tests, multiple imputation and logistic regression. FCCPs were less healthy compared to the matched sample on multiple indicators including general health, emotional support, satisfaction with life, likelihood of not seeing a doctor due to cost or for another reason, consumption of one or more fruits per day, overweight or obese body mass index (BMI), fewer than 7 hours of sleep per night, high blood pressure, diabetes, and asthma. The likelihood of FCCPS being classified as overweight or obese was significantly increased with unhealthy eating, lack of physical activity, and higher than average perceived stress. Study 2. Due to the high levels of overweight and obesity in the first study, the second study was conducted to determine how these high levels might affect the cardiovascular health of FCCPs. This in-person study collected anthropometric and physiological measures in addition to more in-depth survey questions about cardiovascular health on 67 FCCPs. SPSS v23 was again used for descriptives, correlations, multiple imputation, and multiple regression. Two different Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Scores predicting risk for the next 30-years (FRS30) were calculated using BMI (FRS30B) and lipid (FRS30L) measures. The FRS30B was a better assessment in this population than the FRS30L. On average using the FRS30B, FCCPs had a 21.85% chance of having a cardiovascular event in the next 30 years, with 73.13% of over the normal risk and 86.57% over the optimal risk based on FCCP age and sex. Cumulative risk factors (not physically active, unhealthy eating, not seeing a doctor due to cost, arthritis, and depression diagnosis) and cumulative protective factors (low stress, very satisfied with life and would choose child care as career again) were determined based on correlations of over 0.10 with the FRS30B. Cumulative protective factors were found to significantly moderate cumulative risk factors. This finding supports the adapted double ABC-X model for FCCP cardiovascular risk and resilience processes. These studies are the first to provide evidence that, in addition to higher rates of overweight and obesity, FCCPs may also have poorer cardiovascular health. Given the centrality of this setting in the lives of over 1.5 million small children, these results have important implications for intervention work with FCCPs and for further exploring resilience in the context of cardiovascular health.

The analyses of information flow in the news information ecosystem are important issues in social and political science research. However, the sheer amount of news data overwhelms manual analysis. In this dissertation, we present an automatic topic detection and tracking method which can be used to analyze the real world events and their relationships from multimodal TV news data. We propose a Multimodal Topic And-Or Graph (MT-AOG) to jointly rep- resent textual and visual elements of news stories and their latent topic structures. An MT-AOG leverages a context sensitive grammar that can describe the hierarchical composition of news topics by semantic elements about people involved, related places and what happened, and model contextual relationships between elements in the hierarchy. We detect news topics through a cluster sampling process which groups stories about closely related events together. Swendsen-Wang Cuts, an effective cluster sampling algorithm, is adopted for traversing the solution space and obtaining optimal clustering solutions by maximizing a Bayesian posterior probability. The detected topics are then continuously tracked and up- dated with incoming news streams. We generate topic trajectories to show how topics emerge, evolve and disappear over time. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative evaluations to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach over existing methods. We further expand our work to the analysis of campaign communication in recent presidential elections. Specifically, we apply fully automated coding on a massive collection of news and other campaign information to track which candidates are discussed on Twitter and in traditional television news coverage; what topics are being discussed in relation to the candidates and by which news outlets; and which candidates were treated most favorably across news outlets and media. Our methods, which rely on machine learning and digital visual processing, offer promising new methods for social and political science scholars hoping to study large-scale information datasets.

"BR95DW29","thesis","2018","Eisenbruch, Adar Benjamin","Evidence of human adaptations for cooperative partner choice in a biological market","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1977988718?accountid=14026","Despite the importance of human cooperation, how humans choose their cooperative partners and how they divide the spoils of cooperation are not yet fully understood. Mutual partner choice creates competitive conditions for cooperative relationship formation, in which individuals compete to form cooperative relationships with the most valuable available partners. Biological market theory therefore predicts that the spoils of cooperation will be divided as a function of each party's cooperative partner value. This dissertation reports research designed to test two interrelated hypotheses: (1) humans will possess psychological mechanisms designed by natural selection to assess the value of an individual as a long-term cooperative partner, and (2) human intuitions about how the spoils of cooperation should be divided will track cues of cooperative partner value. Six studies were conducted to test these hypotheses. Two commonly-used economic games (the ultimatum game and the trust game) were used to test cooperative partner preferences and resource division intuitions (studies 1-5), and a friend choice task was used to test cooperative partner preferences (study 6). Cooperative partner traits were represented by facial photographs (studies 1, 2 and 6), or were experimentally manipulated with verbal information and in-game monetary consequences (studies 3-5). Results supported the hypotheses. Participants exhibited preferences for partners who appeared more valuable as long-term cooperative partners, and these preferences appeared to be specialized for ancestral forms of cooperation: participants were more sensitive to cues of ancestral productivity than contemporary productivity, participants were more sensitive to cues of productivity when they revealed stable skills rather than luck, and men relied relatively more on a partner's productivity (versus their generosity) than did women. In addition, intuitions about resource divisions were sensitive to cues of partner value: partners who appeared more valuable received more favorable divisions in the ultimatum game, and more productive partners were judged as more fair in the trust game, regardless of their actual generosity. The discussion of results focuses on future directions for the application of biological market theory and the logic of cooperative partner choice to problems in social psychology.

"MPPIUJQH","thesis","2018","Lu, Yanqin","Determinants and consequences of incidental exposure to dissonant political information on Facebook","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1979170938?accountid=14026","The development of communication technologies has brought about remarkable changes in the media environment and generated debates about its influence on the functioning of democracy. A fundamental question is whether these changes keep citizens informed about the competing perspectives of both sides or completely enclosed in an echo chamber. This dissertation contributes to the literature by focusing on a particular mechanism, incidental exposure, through which individuals could encounter some dissonant political information on Facebook. Drawing on a panel survey and a laboratory experiment, this dissertation explores the determinants and consequences of incidental exposure to dissonant political information on Facebook. The frequency of Facebook use is found positively associated with incidental exposure to dissonant political information and this relationship is fully mediated by network heterogeneity. Once individuals incidentally encounter counter-attitudinal posts on Facebook, they are able to recognize and even recall some details of these posts, suggesting the learning effects of incidental exposure. Particularly, when the Facebook posts are endorsed by many others, the eye-tracking data indicate that individuals will spend more time on the area and return to the area more frequently in the course of browsing the Facebook page. As a result, they are better able to recognize these heavily-endorsed counter-attitudinal posts. As for the behavioral consequences, this dissertation does not find a direct impact of incidental exposure to dissonant political information on corrective political participation. Nevertheless, further investigation reveals that this link is moderated by selective exposure. Incidental exposure to dissonant political information has a positive impact on corrective political participation only among individuals who rarely seek out likeminded information on Facebook. In order to better understand the mechanism underlying the behavioral consequence of incidental exposure, this dissertation further explores the indirect effects of anger and anxiety. The findings indicate that incidental exposure to counter-attitudinal posts indirectly encourages corrective political participation via anxiety, but not via anger. Additionally, the indirect effects of anxiety only exist among individuals who consider the covered issue in the Facebook posts relevant to their own well-being. Implications are discussed in terms of the influence of social media use on deliberative and participatory democracies.

The evolution of metacognitive strategies of the students during the activity was also investigated. The participants in this study (n=17) were students enrolled in an introductory English course, taught by the researcher. The students completed the Metacognitive Awareness of Reading Strategies Inventory (MARSI) prior to the start of this study and at its completion (Mokharti & Reichard, 2002). The students used the TopNotes app on first-generation iPads to annotate course-related articles. After annotating, the students completed the Active Engagement Analysis Form (AEAF). The study data revealed that the TopNotes feature most used by students was highlighting. The students also frequently generated arrows to or away from the text, supplemented with comments. The students' comments most often summarized sections of the articles to track their metacognition. Regarding the Active Engagement Analysis Form (AEAF), the students shared mostly favorable perceptions while actively engaging using the TopNotes app. The students were initially deterred by their inexperience with the TopNotes app, specifically with accessing the features and submitting their materials, and by problems with internet connectivity. The Support Reading Strategies subscale and the Overall Reading Strategies score for the MARSI were statistically significant.

At its core, social media is a communication tool that allows like-minded users to communicate and develop relationships, based on common interests. Researchers have attributed social media's success to swift communications and its ability to create relationships. Being able to cultivate this type of relationship network through a company's social media campaign can affect customers' intentions to buy products and services. Many sources indicate that companies are still using social media incorrectly, despite the vast amount of money invested. This study focused on customer to business interactions on Facebook. Previous research suggests that 80% of customer to business communications go unnoticed by businesses on Facebook. This study used multiple rounds of surveys in order to track the movement of customers through the customer life cycle after not receiving a response to a posting on social media. Through a grounded-theory approach to the collection and analysis of the data, a Social Media Communication Nonresponse Model was developed reflecting the responses and actions of customers after not receiving a response to their Facebook post. The model includes five relationship stages (target customer, prospect, new customer, repeat customer, and brand ambassador), four customer needs (marketing, information, support, and acknowledgement), and eight reactions (four of progression: engagement, conversion, repetition, and fruition; and four of regression: regression, stagnation, disillusion and abandonment). The study's findings have implications for the field of social media marketing, particularly for the purposes of communicating with customers directly on Facebook.

"WRFVXYN4","thesis","2018","Moon, Tae Joon","The process of supportive communication and its therapeutic benefits in a smartphone-based addiction treatment group","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2007156347?accountid=14026","The objectives of this dissertation are to examine the nature of supportive communication that is exchanged within smartphone-based peer support groups for people with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and to investigate the impact of three elements of supportive communication behaviors on the recovery from alcohol use disorder: (1) support activation, (2) support provision, and (3) receiving social support matched to support activation. As smartphone-based peer support groups are relatively novel phenomena, this dissertation first analyzed the content of messages exchanged between patients by using corpus analysis, which allowed the researcher to provide a detailed description of linguistic characteristics of messages produced by patients. The current dissertation further conducted a sequential analysis to examine the relationships between messages. This analysis provided a detailed illustration of the process in which social support was activated, provided, and received. Measures of supportive communication behavior (i.e., support activation, support provision, and support reception) were created based on the results from corpus analysis and sequential analysis. By using these measures, this dissertation examined how each of the supportive communication behaviors contributed to the reduction of risky drinking days. The smartphone-based peer support group examined in this dissertation is the Discussion Group within the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Of the 170 study participants who could access the Discussion Groups, 126 participated in a conversation with other patients at least once during the 12-month study period. Messages written by these participants and the structure of conversations among them were interpreted and analyzed through corpus analysis and sequential analysis. The data obtained these analyses were combined with the survey data from pre- and post-test and use log data which included detailed information about the A-CHESS Discussion Group use (e.g., viewing, posting, and replying with a time stamp). The results of corpus analysis revealed that there are four major topics discussed in the A-CHESS Discussion Group: (1) support provision (e.g., emotional support and informational support), (2) self-disclosure of emotional and experiences, (3) public commitment to abstinence and/or recovery principles, and (4) relationship (e.g., greetings, friendship with other members). According to the type of messages that initiated conversations in the Discussion Group, a series of sequential analysis was conducted. The results identified three distinctive sequences in which different messages were statistically significantly connected to others in a sequential manner: (1) Sequence 1: Emotional disclosure/disinhibition &rarr; Emotional Support &rarr; Public commitment; (2) Sequence 2: Public commitment to abstinence &rarr; Emotional support &rarr; Public commitment to recovery principles; and (3) Sequence 3: Self-disclosure &rarr; Emotional support. Each sequence explained how social support was activated and provided. The results also demonstrated that provision of support contributed to behavioral or cognitive adjustment of patients who expressed negative emotion (sequence 1) and reinforced previously presented attitude of patients (sequence 2). Finally, the prediction model revealed that making a public commitment was the strongest predictor of the reduced risky drinking days, followed by support provision and reception of matched support to emotional/personal disclosure. However, emotional/personal disclosure in itself was not related to the risky drinking days and reception of support to matched public commitment was positively related to reduced risky drinking days, requiring further analysis of the ambivalent nature of public commitment.

"UWBALKKY","thesis","2018","Yüksel, Tuğba","Undergraduate students' understanding of concepts foundational to the learning of quantum mechanics (QM) via models-based inquiry","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2016668011?accountid=14026","Studies on secondary and undergraduate students' quantum mechanics (QM) understanding are quite limited in comparison to studies examining students' understandings of classical mechanics. Developments in science and technology, particularly at the nanoscale, have brought attention to the importance of learning quantum physics and its applications not only at the undergraduate level, but also as early as high school. Many postsecondary physics and engineering programs require students to take QM courses. Therefore, the need for research in QM learning has become indispensable, particularly with students' common negative perceptions of QM and their low-level of achievement in these courses (Singh et al., 2006). In this study, I examined undergraduate freshmen and sophomore college-level students' understandings and reasoning of fundamental quantum mechanics concepts as they engaged in a model-based learning module (MBLM). Informed by a pilot study in which I examined engineering and physics students' understanding about basic quantum phenomena (i.e., structure of an atom, energy levels, and atomic spectroscopy), I developed a MBLM for the current investigation. In this study, participants were assigned to one of two groups: intervention and control. The intervention group received a MBLM that guided students to use their reasoning by utilizing physical and visual models with the help of computer-based simulations as well as hands-on models. The control group, on the other hand, received the traditional instructional unit that included textbook and computer-based simulations. Students in both groups engaged with assigned learning materials throughout four weeks (eight hours in total), and after every one or two lessons they took inter-lesson assignments. In order to track growth in students' reasoning and understanding, drawings, diagrams, written and oral explanations, discussions and interviews were collected for both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Based on students' responses in pre- and post-questionnaires, worksheet and inter-lesson assignments, I developed a rubric that includes four model levels: Discrete entity (particle), hybrid, quantum-like and quantum models. As a result, the MBLM group performed better on shifting their model toward targeted (quantum-like or quantum) models than TCBS group. A quantitative analysis showed that model-based inquiry activities facilitated students who were initially in the discrete entity (particle) and hybrid model levels to shifting toward quantum-like and quantum model levels in comparison to traditional textbook and computer-based simulation activities. Moreover, the analysis showed that MBLM students constructed meaningful conceptual understanding and scientifically accurate terminology. Implication for physics courses and teaching/ learning physics are also discussed.

"WAV9QNAU","thesis","2018","Lamb, Steven Michael","The effect of wind-induced tall building motion on occupant comfort, wellbeing, and work performance","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2018647496?accountid=14026","Tall buildings vibrate at low frequencies in response to wind excitation that can be perceptible to building occupants, may cause fear and alarm and can induce motion sickness. The majority of previous research has attempted to determine the thresholds of perception for motion to minimise perceptible motion and therefore reduce the likelihood of occupant complaint. There is insufficient research conducted on actual tall building occupants to investigate whether wind-induced building motion significantly affects occupant comfort, wellbeing and work performance. This thesis investigates the effect of wind-induced building motion on occupant comfort, wellbeing, and work performance, particularly with regard to the effects of typically neglected low-dose symptoms of motion sickness. Study 1 investigates the occupant response to wind-induced building motion in a sample of 1014 office workers in Wellington, New Zealand, known for its consistent high-wind climate. A survey administered at street level, measured detailed information about reported building motion to investigate the role of individual differences, particularly susceptibility to motion sickness, occupant comfort, and compensatory (adaptive) behaviours. Respondents who were highly susceptible to motion sickness reported avoidance of many nauseogenic environments, such as ships and roller coasters, and reported a preference to work on the lower floors of tall buildings. Despite their preferences, highly susceptible individuals were equally likely to work on high floors as the least susceptible individuals. These highly susceptible individuals were subsequently more likely to experience symptoms of motion sickness, and were therefore more likely to engage in compensatory behaviours in an attempt to manage their discomfort. Building motion caused 42% of respondents to report difficulty concentrating, indicating low-dose motion sickness. Despite reported discomfort, respondents directed almost all complaint informally to co-workers and family. Less than 1% (N = 2) of those who reported building motion complained to their ""landlord / property manager"", and no respondents complained directly to the building owner, contradicting the belief that complaint is a valid indicator of building performance. Study 2 compares the results from Study 1 to an identical survey administered in Sydney, Australia. Respondents returned 733 surveys, showing that wind-induced building motion was four times more likely to occur in Wellington than Sydney. Wind-induced building motion was on average felt on significantly higher floors and in taller buildings in Sydney than in Wellington. As in Wellington, highly susceptible Sydney respondents indicated a preference to work on low floors, but were equally likely to work on high floors as the least susceptible individuals. Reports of motion sickness were significantly more frequent in Wellington than Sydney. No Sydney respondents formally complained about building motion. Study 3 examines the effects of wind-induced building motion on the comfort, wellbeing, and work performance of a sample of 47 office workers on high floors of wind-sensitive buildings, compared with a control sample of 53 office workers located near the ground floor. Short 5-minute CAPI (Computer Aided Personal Interviewing) surveys repeatedly measured comfort, wellbeing, and work performance under no-motion conditions and during high winds. Participants completed 2,261 surveys over 8 months. Participant reports of building motion were supported by objectively measured wind speeds and building accelerations (predicted and actual). Clusters of both low-dose (tiredness and distractibility) and high-dose symptoms of motion sickness (nausea and dizziness) were 2-3 times more likely during building motion than under no-motion conditions.

"X3D4QWEL","thesis","2018","Xu, Wenjing","Essays in education, peer effects and decision making","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2035586023?accountid=14026","Peers play an important role in shaping behavior in many contexts. In this dissertation, I study the role of peer interactions on key educational outcomes. In Chapter One, I implement a field experiment to examine the role of social interactions in creating spillover effects. Spillover effects happen when individuals are indirectly affected by an intervention through exposure to other treated individuals. In the experiment, I randomly assign college students in an introductory statistics course to a low-cost behavioral intervention. Treated students receive advice and prompts to make exam study plans. I measure a naturally formed peer network and exploit the exogenous variation in exposure to the intervention in order to causally estimate spillover effects on study behaviors that are transmitted through study partners. I construct a simple social learning model. Additional behavioral evidence further supports the model and I show that the positive spillover effects on untreated students are mostly driven by treated partners who have high beliefs about the return to the applet usage. Surprisingly, I find circumstances under which social interactions reduce the treatment effect. Taken together, this paper provides causal evidence of spillover effects on behavior due to peer interactions and unpacks the complexities behind spillover effects. My results highlight that in networked environments, policy makers should take peer effects into consideration not only to correctly evaluate, but also to leverage social learning to maximize policy impacts. In Chapter Two, I study a natural experiment that randomly assigns students into study groups and estimate the effect of studying with peers of certain characteristics. I find little evidence that peers' background academic performances have significant effects on the course final grade using the traditional linear in the mean model. I find that the group gender mix has an economically and statistically significant impact. In particular, being in groups with more female peers leads to an increase in the course grade for both female and male students. I exploit the course website's log data, and find that one is more likely to download course materials when in more female groups. This is a plausible mechanism through which the gender mix affects the grades. I also find that studying with peers from another lecture section marginally improves one's course grade. My paper therefore provides practical suggestions for assigning students into study groups. In Chapter Three, we use a longitudinal survey design and follow college freshman, in order to provide evidence for two separate mechanisms (homophily and influence) behind similarity in peers' behaviors. This paper demonstrates these effects for the subtle (but broadly important) underlying economic preferences, rather than the observable but potentially domain-specific behaviors previously studied. Subjects participate in three waves of an online experiment where we elicit their social network using an incentive compatible mechanism and then measure participants' levels of altruism, willingness to take risks, and willingness to delay rewards using diagnostic tasks. We find that subjects' risk and time preferences are significantly positively correlated with the preferences of their friends, consistent with peer influence on preferences. Additionally, we find that changes in subject's social networks are significantly influenced by social preferences. Subjects are more likely to add someone as a friend, and less likely to drop as a friend, the more similar their social preferences are.

However, distance education (DE) in Nigeria has not aligned its pedagogy to the new reality in technology. The purposes of this non-experimental, predictive, validity study were to determine faculty and administrators' perceived barriers and concerns to online adoption and to validate the behavior engineering model (BEM) instrument. Ninety-six respondents from four public universities in Nigeria completed the questionnaires. Descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used respectively, to assess barriers and concerns militating against faculty and administrators' online adoption, as well as validate the survey instruments. For faculty and administrators, incentive, motive, knowledge and skills influenced DE adoption. Except for age, all demographic factors influenced faculty's concerns. Gender was observed to influence administrators' concern. ""Level of online use"" influenced neither faculty nor administrators' concerns. Technographic characteristics influenced faculty, but not administrators.' Though the BEM instrument was reliable in measuring faculty and administrator's stages of concern, however, the 6-factor BEM, tested at the 95% significant level, did not give a good fit. The study contributes to positive social change by identifying gaps to effective DE implementation, and recommended the appropriate interventions to transform the DE experience for students and their universities. The study also proposed the framework to fast track Nigeria's vision and mission for DE.

Unlike adults, less is known about the process of relapse in this younger age group. A technology-based remote monitoring system may allow for detailed and accurate characterization of smoking and abstinence and would help to improve cessation strategies. Objectives: This study describes a mobile system that captures smoking using breath carbon monoxide (CO) and real-time self-reports of smoking behavior. Compliance, feasibility, acceptability, and accuracy of the system were measured during a quit attempt and subsequent monitoring period. Methods: The mobile application (My Mobile Monitor, M³) combined breath CO with ecological momentary assessment, delivered via smartphone. Participants ( N = 16; 75% female) were daily smokers between the ages of 19 and 25, who used the app for 11 days during which they agreed to make a quit attempt. Acceptability, compliance, and abstinence were measured. Results: Participants averaged 22.3 ± 2.0 years old and smoked an average of 13.0 ± 6.1 cigarettes per day. Overall session compliance was 69% and during the quit attempt, 56% of participants abstained from smoking for at least 24 hours. Agreement between self-reported smoking compared to breath CO was generally high, when available for comparison, though underreporting of cigarettes was likely. Conclusion: This study demonstrates feasibility of a remote monitoring app with younger smokers, though improvements to promote compliance are needed. Remote monitoring to detect smoking and abstinence represents a step forward in the improvement of cessation strategies, but user experience and personalization are vital.

Although an identity as a drinker is a known predictor of alcohol use and alcohol problems, and early evidence suggests that it also predicts smoking, the role of these behaviors in the development of an identity as a drinker is unknown. In this study, the authors conceptualized a drinker identity as an enduring memory structure referred to as a self-schema and conducted a preliminary investigation of the relationships between early drinking experiences, drinker self-schema, and alcohol and tobacco use in undergraduate students. Methods: Three-hundred thirty undergraduates who reported current alcohol and tobacco use were recruited for an online survey study. Frequency of alcohol and tobacco use in the past 30 days, drinker self-schema, and early experiences with alcohol were measured. Results: Structural equation modeling showed that parental alcohol problems were associated with early onset of drinking. Early onset of drinking and high school friends' drinking were associated with more alcohol use and alcohol-related problems in high school. Alcohol problems during high school were associated with high drinker self-schema scores, which were associated with high frequency of alcohol and tobacco use during college. The indirect effects through the drinker self-schema were significant. Conclusions: Although cross-sectional, this preliminary examination supports theoretical predictions that early alcohol experiences may contribute to development of the drinker self-schema, which, as expected, was positively associated with alcohol and tobacco use in college. Longitudinal studies that track the unfolding of drinking behavior and the contextual factors that are associated with it in the development of the drinker self-schema are essential to confirming the theoretical model. If supported, implications for intervention at different developmental stages to prevent early onset of drinking, limit adolescent alcohol use, and modify the development of a drinker self-schema may mitigate undergraduate drinking and smoking.

In Japan, a strong decline in ratings among critical under-40 demographics had already created tension within the dominant broadcast model when the Fukushima disasters ushered in a crisis of confidence in the nation's journalism. While some Japanese media professionals used the incident as an occasion to engage in self-critique, others largely circumvented the delicate questions of self-censorship, reporters' clubs (kisha kurabu), and sponsor coercion-- and focused instead on restoring audience engagement through the development and testing of pioneering interactive television technology. Meanwhile, the technological rather than ethical focus of post-Fukushima changes inspired a new journalistic movement to create alternative digital spaces for informational exchange and political expression, with the intent of harnessing interactive digital technology in a way that bypasses the government controls and self-censorship characteristic of mainstream Japanese media. Despite a common idealism and intellectual curiosity, the two groups are hindered by divergent structural limitations; television industry insiders are fighting a conservative and imitative corporate climate whose content decisions are governed by the interventions of two monolithic advertising firms, while the independent media are profoundly alienated from this system. Engaging contemporary anthropological conversations concerning the evolving nature of mass media and media professionalism in the digital era, my work tracks the Japanese independent media's epistemic project to reform public culture in Japan and dismantle longstanding barriers to freedom of the press, as well as the mass media's more subtle application of interactive technology to TV content. Thus, I argue that analysis of these Japanese media innovations prompts new theoretical consideration of the divide between expert and amateur production, the use of media to constitute social change, and the nature of television itself.

"9Q5S2YD5","thesis","2018","Frank, Jared Alan","Mobile devices as platforms for estimation, control, and enhanced interaction with physical systems","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2046595960?accountid=14026","In just a short time, mobile devices have revolutionized the way we access information and interact with each other. With an ever expanding list of sensors and features, these devices are also capable of reshaping our experiences with physical systems. Prior efforts to explore this potential of mobile devices have often considered traditional user interfaces, leaving many of the capabilities of the devices untapped. In contrast, we consider the development and evaluation of novel systems that integrate traditional engineering platforms with mobile sensing and computation. Such systems are classified as mobile cyber-physical systems, as the physical behavior of platforms and the performance of integrated mobile technologies become coupled. By shifting sensing and computation onto mobile devices, the systems have distinct affordances, such as platforms with reduced cost and complexity. Furthermore, by employing visual sensing and interactive graphics on the device, mobile mixed-reality interfaces are designed that yield intuitive and engaging user experiences. However, limitations in mobile sensing and computation introduce challenges in implementation. Thus, a series of experiments and user studies are conducted to characterize the performance needs of such systems and to formulate solutions that address them. First, we investigate how mobile devices enable the design of intuitive metaphors for mapping user interactions with devices to commands for operating physical systems. Then, we explore the potential of mobile devices to aid in the estimation and control of systems built from laboratory test-beds modified according to two fundamentally different approaches. In the first approach, smartphones are mounted directly to test-beds to facilitate inertial- and/or vision-based measurement and control of test-beds. In the second approach, tablets are held such that their rear-facing cameras allow for vision-based measurement and control of test-beds as well as delivery of mobile mixed-reality interfaces for interacting with test-beds. Experiments validate the feasibility of the two approaches and uncover the factors that impact stability and performance. Moreover, we examine the use of developed systems as educational platforms that engage learners in new and interactive ways. Results of user studies indicate that the utilization of mobile technologies creates opportunities to deliver learning experiences that benefit from access to both concrete physical models and interactive visualizations of concepts, and permits the development of more portable, affordable, and engaging platforms for science and engineering education. Finally, we explore the application of the mobile mixed-reality approach to interactions in shared spaces with various robotic systems that have limited perception and computational power. Results of experiments in which participants command a robot to manipulate objects indicate that mobile mixed reality provides acceptable performance and user experiences as compared to conventional approaches, without the need to install sophisticated hardware on or around the robot. A novel vision-based control approach is presented in which the state of a mobile robot is coupled with that of an interactive virtual representation of the robot maintained by a mobile interface. Results of experiments in which participants generate paths and maps for mobile robots to use in planning and navigation show that robots can be driven along desired paths either drawn directly by the user or generated by an algorithm developed to correct user-drawn paths that cause collisions. Then, a technique is presented that uses both a mobile device's visual and inertial data to track, control, and interact with swarms of small, simple mobile robots that have no sensors.

"J4YQMSSX","thesis","2018","Alsaif, Ghada Abdulaziz","Benefits of online class notifications on higher education courses","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2050124547?accountid=14026","This study investigates the effects of using online notifications in higher education courses. University students in Education and Design courses received weekly notification advising them on: upcoming instruction, recommended readings, study groups, due dates for assignments, activities and exams. The students received the notifications on their preferred media. They either used both mobile devices (cell phones or tablets), or fixed desktop computers in their homes or university. The study sought to understand how students value class notifications and how the effectiveness of notifications was influence by usage factors such as: mobile or fixed access, usage skills, types of notifications, and demographic factors such as age, sex, major and academic year. The study used both quantitative and qualitative techniques in collecting and analyzing data. Students in Education (N=32) and Design (N=37) courses participated in a 16-week intervention followed by an online survey. Carefully timed and designed messages were distributed throughout the semester. A 77 item survey was sent to 69 applicants. One-way ANOVA, independent-sample t-test, and correlation coefficient were used to compare the relation between the value of notification and the usage and demographic factors. Descriptive statistics were used to examine students' perspectives of class notifications. The mean values of the 6 class notifications items (M=4) was significantly above the 3 likert scale midpoint (p<.000). A correlation coefficient was used to determine associations between the survey items. Among other quantitative findings the results showed a significant positive correlation between the Value of Class Notifications and Mobile Technology Use (r=.355, p=0.016) and Value of Class Notifications and Usage Skills (r=0.351, p=0.017). Responses to the open-ended qualitative questions indicate that online class notifications assist learners significantly in meeting class expectations. Notification also supports learners in completing tasks in a timely fashion. This study shows that class notification are particularly beneficial when they are continuously accessible from mobile devices, when the learners are skilled in using the notifications and when the notifications are related to course expectations. Qualitative analysis indicated that by assisting students in keeping track of class activities and due dates, notifications can reduce mental load, encourage social engagement with teachers as well as peers and foster a greater belonging in university courses. Further studies may wish to consider the influence of class notification on achievement and students perception of course organization and quality.

The gender gap for interest in STEM subjects is not present in students in the early grades. Yet, studies demonstrate that from the time a girl enters school in kindergarten until the time she begins her senior year of high school, chances are she will have lost much of that interest in STEM subjects as compared to her male peers. Indeed, only about 36% of undergraduate STEM degrees and 19% of undergraduate physics degrees were awarded to US women in 2015. This study used a pre/post intervention designed to offer students choices of different contexts (biological/health, sports, and traditional) for physics problems. These choices were intended to potentially increase the interest of students, especially females, in the subject matter - with the intention of also positively impacting their achievement. Students' interests, beliefs, conceptual understanding, and motivation toward learning physics in a high school unit on Newton's Laws were examined before and following their completion of an online homework unit composed of these problems. This study was informed by Artino's social-cognitive model of academic motivation and emotion, using choice in an online learning environment (WebAssign) to see if this experience would lead to different academic outcomes. Three research questions guided this study. When given assignment choices designed around gender stereotype: Which types of physics problems do males and females select? Are there any differences in achievement of males and females, and is this related to the types of physics questions they select or other factors?; What are students' attitudes toward, beliefs about, and interest in physics, and what accounts for any changes that occur over the unit? Seventy-one students in high school physics classes, from five US states, participated in this mixed methods study. Homework problems created on WebAssign were designed, based on the literature, to investigate the role that the context of a physics question has on the type of physics problems male and female students prefer. Three contexts were used: traditional, biological/health, and sports. Fifteen written questions and six questions using a video format made up the intervention. After answering a question, students were prompted to explain their reason for choosing that version of the problem. All of the homework problems were scored, most of which had two or three parts. Students were allowed to re-do a homework problem, for a maximum of five 'tries.' The online program also kept track of the order of the choices made by students and the amount of time they spent on the homework problems. Participants were given the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) to evaluate students' conceptual knowledge, and the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) to measure changes in attitudes, both pre-and post-intervention. Compared with males, females saw improvements from pre to post measure in the Sense Making category of the CLASS, but saw decreases in attitudes on items used in the Problem Solving, Problem Solving Confidence, Conceptual Understanding, and Real World and Personal Interests categories. Females showed gains in trusting their calculations, compared with male students, if the calculation gave a result that was different from what they initially expected, but females also were less likely to expect that physics equations would help their understanding and that they were just for calculations. Males saw a decrease in being satisfied with working on a problem until they understood why it worked the way it does, as compared with their initial attitude. However, students reported… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)","2018","2020-06-05 21:19:34","2020-06-05 21:19:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","North Carolina State University","","English","","Ph.D.","APA PsycInfo®","2056717506; 2018-21180-158","","","Publication Title: Dissertation Abstracts International Section A: Humanities and Social Sciences AAI10759003","","","http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:APA+PsycInfo%C2%AE&atitle=&title=Using+choice+to+uncover+the+role+of+gender+stereotypes+in+high+school+physics+assignments%3A+Examining+students%27+interests%2C+beliefs%2C+conceptual+understanding+and+motivations&issn=&date=2018-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Wheeler%2C+Samuel+Ramon&isbn=978-0355635799&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2018-21180-158&rft_id=info:doi/","Motivation; motivation; gender stereotypes; Human; Empirical Study; Quantitative Study; Adolescence (13-17 yrs); 3500:Educational Psychology; Concept Formation; conceptual understanding; High School Education; high school physics assignments; Stereotyped Behavior; students' interests","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most recently, Diagnostic Classification Models (DCMs) have been used to track skill acquisition in a longitudinal fashion, with the purpose to provide an estimate of students’ learning trajectories in terms of the change of fine-grained skills overtime. Response time (RT), the amount of time the test taker spends considering and answering each item, has been extensively studied and used in testing environments as a useful source of information to reflect individual response behavior and item characteristics. In this study, we consider using RTs in a learning environment to model students’ learning progress. This could provide additional diagnostic information on students’ fluency of applying the mastered skills. We propose a framework to model changes in RTs with a higher-order hidden Markov DCM. The proposed models are evaluated through a computer-based learning system that is designed to improve students’ spatial skills. Results indicate that the proposed model can demonstrate both within and between group differences in learning through the predicted growth of latent speed on different items.

"6GEZSLGH","thesis","2018","Taub, Michelle","Using multi-channel data to assess, understand, and support metacognition with advanced learning technologies","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/2058447645?accountid=14026","Overall, the goal of this dissertation is to use three manuscripts to demonstrate why we need to use multi-channel data to measure self-regulated learning, and specifically metacognitive processes, during learning with advanced learning technologies, and why we need to move beyond using only self-report measures and traditional inferential statistics to measure how students use metacognitive self-regulated learning processes during learning with advanced learning technologies. I will provide specific empirical evidence revealing how using multi-level modeling, sequential pattern mining, and differential sequence mining can be used to explain the temporal dynamics of self-regulated learning unfolding over time, and how we can use this to develop advanced learning technologies that are adaptive to individual learning needs. The first manuscript is a theoretical chapter where Azevedo, Taub, & Mudrick (in press) present the challenges faced by researchers when measuring self-regulated learning during learning with different types of advanced learning technologies, including relying on self-report measures, as well as new challenges to consider when measuring self-regulated learning with multi-channel data, such as temporal alignment of data. In the second manuscript, Taub, Mudrick, Azevedo, Millar, Rowe, & Lester (in press) used multi-level modeling with log files and eye-tracking data to determine how students' use of metacognitive monitoring strategies impacted their performance on an in-game assessment when reading content during learning while playing CRYSTAL ISLAND, a game-based advanced learning technology that fosters scientific reasoning and literacy skills. In the third manuscript, Taub, Azevedo, Bradbury, Millar, & Lester (revise and resubmit) used sequential pattern mining and differential sequence mining to investigate metacognitive monitoring during students' hypothesis testing activities to determine if the sequences in which students tested their hypotheses different based on their efficiency in gameplay during learning with CRYSTAL ISLAND. Overall, results indicated that by directly addressing the methodological and analytical issues discussed in the chapter about the need for using multi-channel data and non-traditional statistical techniques, the authors were able to investigate instances of metacognitive monitoring during learning while playing CRYSTAL ISLAND. These results reveal that metacognitive monitoring can be defined differently based on the activity students are doing (e.g., knowledge acquisition vs. hypothesis testing), and that using multi-channel data and non-traditional statistical approaches were helpful methodological tools and analytical techniques for investigating metacognitive monitoring, compared to traditional approaches of using self-report measures and traditional inferential statistics. Broader implications from these manuscripts focus predominantly on the importance of context. Theoretically, defining metacognitive self-regulated learning processes will depend on the specific task students are doing. Methodologically, determining which data channels are the most appropriate variables to use to investigate metacognitive self-regulated learning processes will also depend on the specific activity students are engaging in. Analytically, the most appropriate statistical analysis techniques will depend on the research questions being asked for the analysis. Therefore, context will largely impact decisions for conducting research studies, with results aiming towards the design and development of adaptive advanced learning technologies that foster individualized learning for all student.

National security officials must distinguish between terrorist activities carried out by lone wolves and those carried out by terrorist networks for effective intervention and potential prevention. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the phenomenon of the leaderless lone wolf terrorist and the underlying mechanisms and processes that lead individuals to be drawn to or away from an existing radical movement. The theoretical framework for this study was leaderless resistance theory. Secondary data from interviews, field notes, and surveys from the RAND-MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base and the Global Terrorism Database were analyzed using open and selective coding. Findings revealed 3 individual-level underlying mechanisms and processes (personal and political grievance, risk and status seeking, unfreezing) that lead individuals to be drawn to or away from an existing radical movement and to act unilaterally without direction toward violent ends. Findings also indicated that no single typology fits all perpetrators. The findings benefit national security officials and intelligence agencies by identifying lone wolf individuals, weighing the actual threat versus the perception, developing better counterterrorism strategies for the lone wolf phenomenon, and enhancing relations with outside agencies. Results may improve understanding of lone wolf terrorism and may be used to develop new policies to predict and track future threats.

On social media, people talk about their lifestyle, health conditions and symptoms, search information on treatment options, and connect with people who have been through similar medical experiences to get emotional support. Such health information generated by patients or family members is not available in medical documents created by health care providers and became publicly available only recently with the prevalent use of microblogging sites, which makes social media an invaluable source of health data to mine. However, social media data is often short, unstructured, and written in colloquial languages, and these characteristics pose many interesting research questions. In this thesis, we focused on mining public Twitter data for healthcare intelligence. We designed models based on bag-of-words and social network structure features that classify trending topics into general categories such as sports, technology and health. This model could help identify trending topics and posts in health domain and benefit information retrieval tasks by reducing the search space to a domain of interest. We also proposed a real-time digital disease surveillance system that uses spatial, temporal, and text mining techniques to track disease activities. Our work was motivated by the fact that, while traditional disease surveillance systems require 1--2 weeks time to collect and process before the data becomes publicly available, Twitter data is available near real-time and the aggregated social media data can provide an overall health state of the general population earlier than the traditional disease surveillance systems can. We further built a neural network model that combines Twitter data with the observed data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to predict current and future influenza activities. Our system can serve as a proxy for early detection of pandemics and the resulting insights are expected to help facilitate faster response to and preparation for epidemics. We also investigated the use of clinical knowledge sources to train deep learning models for medical concept normalization in which health conditions described in natural (colloquial) language are mapped to a standard clinical term. The proposed model can help an automatic system to effectively interpret health concepts written in layman's language. The studies presented in this thesis provide interesting insights into the application of machine learning and text mining on social media data in healthcare domain. We hope our work motivates further study of online user-generated data to gain meaningful healthcare insights.

This research studies how major road drivers respond to the aggressive maneuvering of the minor road drivers at unsignalized intersections. The study was also designed to investigate the effect of distracted driving (engaged on handheld phone) on driving performance. In our experiments, 51 drivers were tested for four different events using a driving simulator. The test track comprised of a stretch of 10.4 km having nine unsignalized intersections. A possible conflicting event was designed at each intersection for approaching major road drivers. The major road driver behavior was evaluated with reference to three variables: response time before possible conflict (RTPC), average speed while approaching intersection and at the intersection, and deceleration rate. The analysis results showed that the RTPC values against the right turning vehicles were very low indicating high risk against right turning vehicles (considering left side driving practice). For the same event with handheld phone conversation, the RTPC values were found to be negative indicating that the drivers are more likely to miss the visual reaction time stimuli when engaged in a phone conversation. The 10th and 90th percentile RTPC values were found to vary from 6.3 to 9.4 s and 0.1 to 1.8 s respectively for different events. The driving speed of the drivers was not found to be significantly impacted by the cell phone usage. The approach speed for all drivers at the intersection was found to be lower by 35–40% compared to speeds before responding to the conflicting vehicle. The average decelerating rate for all the drivers was found to be 3.73 m/s² and 4.23 m/s² when the participants were driving without phone and with phone respectively. The insights from this study can be used to understand pre-crash driver actions which are necessary for the implementation of appropriate countermeasures and to assess the level of safety at unsignalized intersections.

It does this largely through the words and metaphors available to speakers in a particular culture for representing and communicating their experiences. The purpose of this chapter is to describe some of the linguistic resources available to people in our culture (with a few examples from other cultures) for discussing experiences of self-related insight. These resources include a stock of words for insight and related experiences, the syntax in which those words are embedded, and the underlying metaphors implicit in the stock of words. A close analysis of insight discourse should pay dividends in two ways: First, it will reduce conceptual confusion, thus fostering better theories and research. Second, it will further the understanding of people's experience of insight, which will facilitate the ability to track what clients get out of therapy. In modern Western societies, the concept of insight is central to shared cultural understandings of the institution of psychotherapy. The cultural script, fed by more a century of media presentations of therapy (cf. Brandell, 2004), emphasizes insight into connections between past trauma and current problems as the central change process in psychotherapy. But what is insight? And how do speakers in our culture accomplish discourses that recognizably exemplify this cultural script? Using the methods of discourse analysis (DA), these questions can be approached from different angles, including deconstruction of general language usage (standard dictionary definitions, etymology, and synonyms) and examination of texts in which clients describe specific insights in their treatments. I offer examples of both of these in this chapter.

Recent studies have shown up to 24% loss to follow-up of HIV patients in Africa during treatment and many patients not being started on treatment at all. Some programs for prevention of maternal–child transmission have more than 80% loss to follow-up of babies born to HIV-positive mothers. These patients are at great risk of dying or developing drug resistance if their antiretroviral therapy is interrupted. Similar problems have been found in the scale-up of MDR-TB treatment. Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess the role of medical information systems in tracking patients with HIV or MDR-TB, ensuring they are promptly started on high quality care, and reducing loss to follow-up. Methods: A literature search was conducted starting from a previous review and using Medline and Google Scholar. Due to the nature of this work and the relative lack of published articles to date, the authors also relied on personal knowledge and experience of systems in use and their own assessments of systems. Results: Functionality for tracking patients and detecting those lost to follow-up is described in six HIV and MDR-TB treatment projects in Africa and Latin America. Preliminary data show benefits in tracking patients who have not been prescribed appropriate drugs, those who fail to return for follow-up, and those who do not have medications picked up for them by health care workers. There were also benefits seen in providing access to key laboratory data and in using this data to improve the timeliness and quality of care. Follow-up was typically achieved by a combination of reports from information systems along with teams of community health care workers. New technologies such as low-cost satellite Internet access, personal digital assistants, and cell phones are helping to expand the reach of these systems. Conclusions: Effective information systems in developing countries are a recent innovation but will need to play an increasing role in supporting and monitoring HIV and MDR-TB projects as they scale up from thousands to hundreds of thousands of patients. A particular focus should be placed on tracking patients from initial diagnosis to initiation of effective treatment and then monitoring them for treatment breaks or loss to follow-up. More quantitative evaluations need to be performed on the impact of electronic information systems on tracking patients.

Wiemer-Hastings, P. Wiemer-Hastings, Kreuz, & Harter, 1999). AutoTutor simulates the discourse patterns of human tutors and a number of ideal tutoring strategies. It presents a series of challenging problems (or questions) from a curriculum script and engages in collaborative, mixed initiative dialog while constructing answers. AutoTutor speaks the content of its turns through an animated conversational agent with a speech engine; it was designed to be a good conversational partner that comprehends, speaks, points, and displays emotions, all in a coordinated fashion. For some topics, there are graphical displays, animations of causal mechanisms, or interactive simulation environments (Graesser, Chipman, Haynes, & Olney, 2005). So far, AutoTutor has been developed and tested for topics in Newtonian physics (VanLehn et al., in press) and computer literacy (Graesser, Lu, et al., 2004), showing impressive learning gains compared to pretest measures and suitable control conditions. One notable characteristic of AutoTutor, from the standpoint of the present edited volume, is that latent semantic analysis (LSA) was adopted as its primary representation of world knowledge. This chapter begins by briefly describing AutoTutor and how LSA is used to track the learner's coverage of the subject matter. We subsequently report a serious of analyses that assess how well LSA performs in determining whether paragraph-length or sentence-length information packages are covered by the learner. These evaluations have been performed on student essays and on the dynamic conversations that emerge over multiple turns in tutorial dialogue.

The model provides imagery guidelines which identify seven key factors (physical, environment, task, timing, learning, emotion, perspective) that should be included when developing interventions to maximise functional equivalence. This study explored the effect of a short-term PETTLEP imagery intervention, compared to ‘traditional’ imagery, on a computer game: Need for Speed Underground 2 (EA games). Eighty participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: PETTLEP imagery group, ‘traditional’ imagery group, physical practice group and control group. After three practice attempts, pre-tests consisted of five attempts at the game. The game involved completing timed laps by manoeuvring a vehicle around a track using the computer’s arrow keys. The PETTLEP group completed individualised response training, and then performed imagery sitting in front of the computer screen and repeatedly imaging themselves completing the task. The ‘traditional’ imagery group was sat in a separate room, given individualised stimulus training and instructed to relax and close their eyes during imagery. The physical practice group performed the actual task. Each intervention lasted for forty-five minutes, immediately followed by the post-test, which again consisted of five attempts at the game. A group x test ANOVA showed that the PETTLEP imagery group and physical practice group both improved significantly from pre-test to post-test (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the magnitude of their improvements. The traditional imagery and control groups showed no increase in performance from pre-test to post-test (p>0.05). The results strongly support the use of PETTLEP in enhancing performance on a cognitive task. Contrary to previous studies, PETTLEP was as effective as physical practice. This finding could have important implications for athletes returning from injury, suffering from over-training and for use in pre-performance routines. Therefore, sports psychologists should maximise the functional equivalence of their imagery interventions to have the greatest positive effect on performance on such cognitive tasks, at least in the short term. Future research needs to focus on applying short-term PETTLEP interventions to different tasks, varying in cognitive complexity. Assessing the effectiveness of PETTLEP imagery used in various combinations with physical practice would also be a useful addition to the literature.

However, customization requires an in-depth analysis of current customer preferences and an evaluation of future behavior. The main objective of the paper is to present a framework for analyzing changes of customer preferences. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents detailed results of independent customer satisfaction surveys conducted in different time periods in the Greek ISP market. The analyses are based on non-parametric statistical techniques and the multicriteria satisfaction analysis method, which is a multicriteria preference disaggregation approach. Findings: Results are mainly focused on the evaluation of potential trends of e-customer preferences. Furthermore, results of a benchmarking analysis are also presented, based on the evolution of satisfaction levels for the quality characteristics of the provided services. Research limitations/implications: Future research in the context of the presented study may be focused on satisfaction benchmarking analysis, given the rapid changes of the market conditions. An extended satisfaction survey will give the ability to analyze customer preferences in comparison with the main ISP competitors. Practical implications: The presented study may help organizations in highly competitive markets dominated by rapid technological progresses to track short-term changes of customer preferences. Originality/value: The analyses presented are based on the combination of multicriteria analysis and non-parametric statistics. The main advantage of these methods is that they respect the qualitative (ordinal) form of collected survey data.

This paper describes an exploratory experiment designed to investigate the effectiveness of a prototype of such a system in training a navigation task. A wearable computer, acoustic tracking system, and see-through head mounted display (HMD) were used to wirelessly track users' head position and orientation while presenting a graphic representation of their virtual surroundings, through which the user walked using natural movement. As previous studies have shown that virtual environments can be used to train navigation, the ability to add natural movement to a type of virtual environment may enhance that training, based on the proprioceptive feedback gained by walking through the environment. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: route drawing on printed floor plan, rehearsal in the actual facility, and rehearsal in a mixed reality (MR) environment. Participants, divided equally between male and female in each group, studied verbal directions of route, then performed three rehearsals of the route, with those in the map condition drawing it onto three separate printed floor plans, those in the practice condition walking through the actual facility, and participants in the MR condition walking through a three dimensional virtual environment, with landmarks, waypoints and virtual footprints. A scaling factor was used, with each step in the MR environment equal to three steps in the real environment, with the MR environment also broken into ""tiles"", like pages in an atlas, through which participant progressed, entering each tile in succession until they completed the entire route. Transfer of training testing that consisted of a timed traversal of the route through the actual facility showed a significant difference in route knowledge based on the total time to complete the route, and the number of errors committed while doing so, with ""walkers"" performing better than participants in the paper map or MR condition, although the effect was weak. Survey knowledge showed little difference among the three rehearsal conditions. Three standardized tests of spatial abilities did not correlate with route traversal time, or errors, or with 3 of the 4 orientation localization tasks. Within the MR rehearsal condition there was a clear performance improvement over the three rehearsal trials as measured by the time required to complete the route in the MR environment which was accepted as an indication that learning occurred. As measured using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, there were no incidents of simulator sickness in the MR environment. Rehearsal in the actual facility was the most effective training condition; however, it is often not an acceptable form of rehearsal given an inaccessible or hostile environment. Performance between participants in the other two conditions were indistinguishable, pointing toward continued experimentation that should include the combined effect of paper map rehearsal with mixed reality, especially as it is likely to be the more realistic case for mission rehearsal, since there is no indication that maps should be eliminated. To walk through the environment beforehand can enhance the Soldiers' understanding of their surroundings, as was evident through the comments from participants as they moved from MR to the actual space: ""This looks like I was just here"", and ""There's that pole I kept having trouble with"". Such comments lead one to believe that this is a tool to continue to explore and apply. While additional research on the scaling and tiling factors is likely warranted, to determine if the effect can be applied to other environments or tasks, it should be pointed out that this is not a new task for most adults who have interacted with maps, where a scaling factor of 1 to 15,000 is common in orienteering maps, and 1 to 25,000 in (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","2007","2020-06-05 21:24:20","2020-06-05 21:24:20","","","5450","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","APA PsycInfo®","622009342; 2007-99006-084","","","Publication Title: Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering AAI3233674","","","http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:APA+PsycInfo%C2%AE&atitle=&title=Training+wayfinding%3A+Natural+movement+in+mixed+reality&issn=&date=2007-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Savage%2C+Ruthann&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2007-99006-084&rft_id=info:doi/","Female; Male; mixed reality; Virtual Reality; virtual environment; Human; Tracking; Human Computer Interaction; Empirical Study; Acoustics; Quantitative Study; 2300:Human Experimental Psychology; acoustic tracking system; natural movement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the decline in the percentage of youth reporting sexual solicitations was apparent for both boys and girls, all age groups, but not among minority youth and those living in less affluent households. The increase in harassment among particular sub-groups of youth was largely explained by increases in amount of Internet use over the past five years. The increase in unwanted exposure to pornography was particularly apparent among 10- to 12-year-olds, 16- to 17-year-olds, boys, and White, non-Hispanic youth. Conclusions: The decline in the percentage of youth reporting sexual solicitations may be the effect of education and law enforcement activity on this issue in the intervening years. Targeted prevention efforts for minority youth and those living in less affluent households need to be developed. The rise in unwanted pornography exposure may reflect technological changes such as digital photography, faster Internet connections and computer storage capacities, as well as the more aggressive marketing strategies of pornography merchants.

When other factors are controlled, years of online experience is a strong predictor of the likelihood of a person doing specific searches on a daily basis, and experience can have an even stronger positive effect than education and income.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2006-08468-010). Exponential advances have been made regarding computer/Internet technology in the past decade. This growth, in large part, can be attributed to greater access to, affordability of, and anonymity while on the computer. However, this progress has also produced negative psychological issues. Problematic Internet-enabled sexual behavior (IESB) has increasingly affected individuals' family relationships, work productivity, and academic success. This article is the first-known, empirically based outcome study regarding the effectiveness of group therapy treatment for men with problematic IESB. These closed-groups, which ran for 16 weeks, used a combination of Readiness to Change (RtC), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and Motivational Interviewing (MI) interventions. Five groups were analyzed for this paper (yielding a total N of 35), with the average member's age being 44.5 years old. Three different scales (the Orzack Time Intensity Survey, the BASIS-32, and the BDI) were used to track participants' progress across time. The results demonstrated that this group treatment intervention significantly increased members' quality of life and decreased the severity of their depressive symptoms. However, the protocol failed to reduce participants' inappropriate computer use. Regarding comorbidity, the results showed the following: members in the ""anxiety"" category responded best to the current treatment, those in the ""mood"" cluster responded relatively positively, and those in the ""A-D/HD"" category failed to respond significantly. It is clear from this report that more attention must be focused on the treatment of problematic IESB, as opposed to exploratory studies.

Data were collected via questionnaire and computer use-monitoring software. Results showed students' attitudes were generally quite positive towards the TPCs, although they did not tend to think TPCs had improved their grades, few disagreed that TPCs were a distraction in class, and visual and musculoskeletal discomfort was prevalent. Understanding how to use the TPC and recognizing its organizational capacity were associated with several positive attitudes towards the TPC, including making school more enjoyable. Children's exposure to computers will only increase, so study of the many dimensions of their impact is critical in order to understand what is effective, constructive and healthful for children.

Methods: The D-SMART was integrated into computer and telephonic systems at 5 sites within the Pittsburgh Regional Initiative for Diabetes Education (PRIDE) network. Data were obtained from 290 patients with diabetes using the system at these programs via paper-and-pencil questionnaires following baseline D-SMART assessments and electronic system measurement of system performance. Process evaluation included time of completion, understanding content, usability of technology, and satisfaction with the system. Patients were 58% female and 85% Caucasian and had a mean age of 58 years. Fifty-six percent of patients had no more than a high school education, and 78% had Internet access at home. Results: Most patients reported completing the D-SMART at home (78%), in 1 attempt (86%) via the Internet (55%), and in less than 30 minutes. Seventy-six percent believed the questions were easy to understand, and 80% did not need assistance. Age was negatively associated with ease of use. Moreover, 76% of patients believed the D-SMART helped them think about their diabetes, with 67% indicating that it gave the diabetes educator good information about themselves and their diabetes. Most (94%) were satisfied with the D-SMART. Level of satisfaction was independent of the system being used. Conclusions: The D-SMART was easily completed at home in 1 attempt, content was understandable, and patients were generally satisfied with the wording of questions and selection of answers. The D-SMART is easy to use and enhanced communication between the patient and clinician; however, elderly patients may need more assistance. Computer-based and telephonic D-SMARTs appear to be feasible and useful assessment methods for diabetes educators.

The number of responding schools was 135 (44%). The family nurse practitioner program continues to be the most offered advanced practice nursing program. Nearly all institutions offer a post-master's program and an advanced health assessment course to their clinical graduate students. Health assessment is usually taught concurrently or as a prerequisite for clinical experiences; there continues to be a strong emphasis on the physical examination component. Ethnic and cultural assessment and gerontological assessment content increased since the original study. Both class and laboratory class sizes decreased. Qualitative data that centered on differences in graduate versus undergraduate health assessment revealed a shift in focus in several areas: differential diagnoses, abnormals, and the inclusion of advanced skills.

It investigates three questions. 1. How do programmers integrate debugging strategies and tactics when working with SDEs? 2. What is the relationship between verbal ability, level of graphical literacy and debugging (task) performance. 3. How do modality and perspective influence debugging strategy and deployment of tactics? The paper extends the work of Katz and Anderson [1988. Debugging: an analysis of bug location strategies. Human-Computer Interaction 3, 359-399] and others in terms of identifying high level debugging strategies, in this case when working with SDEs. It also describes how programmers of different backgrounds and degrees of experience make differential use of the multiple sources of information typically available in a software debugging environment. Individual difference measures considered among the participants were their programming experience and their knowledge of external representation formalisms. The debugging environment enabled the participants, computer science students, to view the execution of a program in steps and provided them with concurrently displayed, adjacent, multiple and linked programming representations. These representations comprised the program code, two visualisations of the program and its output. The two visualisations of the program were available, in either a largely textual format or a largely graphical format so as to track interactions between experience and low level mode-specific tactics, for example. The results suggest that (i) additionally to deploying debugging strategies similar to those reported in the literature, participants also employed a strategy specific to SDEs, following execution, (ii) verbal ability was not correlated with debugging performance, (iii) knowledge of external representation formalisms was as important as programming experience to succeed in the debugging task, and (iv) participants with greater experience of both programming and external representation formalisms, unlike the less experienced, were able to modify their debugging strategies and tactics effectively when working under different format conditions (i.e. when working with either largely graphical or largely textual visualisations) in order to maintain their high debugging accuracy level.

Subjects were 9 female patients with CFS and 9 healthy women. A watch-type computer was used to collect real-time data on physical and psychological symptoms and cognitive function for 1week before and 2weeks after a maximal exercise test. For each variable, we investigated temporal changes after exercise using multilevel modeling. Following exercise, physical symptoms did get worse but not until a five-day delay in CFS patients. Despite this, there was no difference in the temporal pattern of changes in psychological symptoms or in cognitive function after exercise between CFS patients and controls. In conclusion, physical symptoms worsened after several days delay in patients with CFS following exercise while psychological symptoms or cognitive function did not change after exercise.

Design: Cross-sectional descriptive, correlational study of 2,580 persons with FM who responded to an online survey during fall 2005. Methods: The survey indicated self-reported physical activity levels, functional abilities, symptoms, health care costs, employment status, work productivity, self management strategies. It had adequate validity and reliability. A significant binary logistic regression model of predictors of physical function (individual factors, symptoms, self management strategies) was validated using backwards logistic regression. Findings: Significant explanatory variables of high physical function were: men, greater education, younger age, lower intensity fatigue, spasticity, and balance problems, not using prescription pain medications, using aerobic or strength training exercise, and not using relaxation methods. Conclusions: People with FM suffer from multiple symptoms and use many modalities to control symptoms to remain functional. Given knowledge of predictors of physical function in FM, health care providers might be able to develop strategies to promote better functioning. Prospective trials are needed to track the natural course of study variables, measuring their effect on function, and to test effects of interventions to maximize function.

Players had to report their chess rating, the number of hours of individual and group practice, their use of different learning resources and activities, and whether they had been trained by a coach. The use of archival data enabled us to track the rating of some of the players throughout their career. We found that there was a strong correlation between chess skill and number of hours of practice. Moreover, group practice was a better predictor of high-level performance than individual practice. We also found that masters had a higher chess rating than expert players after only three years of serious dedication to chess, although there were no differences in the number of hours of practice. The difference that may explain the variation in rating is that masters start practising at an earlier age than experts. Finally, we found that activities such as reading books and using computer software (game databases, but not playing programs) were important for the development of high-level performance. Together with previous data and theories of expert performance, our results indicate limits in the deliberate practice framework and make suggestions on how best to carry out learning in chess and in other fields.

In addition, this study examined if the support for NCAA Division I athletic reform differed based on the sex of the respondent, the race of the respondent and between the head coaches of revenue and non-revenue sports. After eliminating duplicate and incorrect email addresses, the population of this study was 559. A census of all athletic directors, senior woman administrators, faculty athletic representatives, and head coaches of football men's and woman's basketball, men's and woman's track and field and woman's volleyball was used from the six major Division IA BCS Conferences (ACC, Big East, Big Ten, Big Twelve, SEC, and PAC 10). Questionnaires were returned by 139 respondents for a response rate of 24.8% with 127 being usable data. Each participant was asked to complete an online survey consisting of 35 statements pertaining to one of six categories (1) presidential control, (2) academic integrity, (3) financial integrity, (4) athlete welfare, (5) governance, and (6) equity. In addition, the participants were asked to complete eight demographic questions as well as two open ended questions regarding intercollegiate athletic reform. The researcher analyzed the data using SPSS version 14. Item-to-total correlations and Cronbach's Alpha's was used to determine internal consistency and reliability of the instrument. Furthermore, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to answer research question #1 to determine significance between position and the dependant variables. In addition, Scheffe Post Hoc test was used to examine where the significance was between the variables. Multiple t-tests were used to examine research question #2 while mean scores and standard variations were analyzed for research question #3 and mean scores were analyzed for question #4. Results showed support for three of the six categories (presidential control reform, race equity reform, and gender equity reform). Furthermore, significance was found between position and five of the six categories (presidential control, athlete welfare, financial integrity, gender equity and governance) as well as between gender and three of the six categories (gender equity, race equity, and governance). Implications of the results of the study are discussed and recommendations for future research are suggested.

In addition, researchers, especially those in computer-mediated communication (CMC), have demonstrated the operation of fundamental SLA principles and also extended our understanding of those principles.

To compensate for the reduced revenue and remain competitive, a number of these institutions have discovered new and creative ways to raise money, such as using the Internet. This study examined the impact that the Internet has on business school philanthropy and identified online giving trends among randomly selected AACSB International accredited institutions in the United States. A 20-item questionnaire was used to measure the results. Of the 107 business schools that participated in this study, 36.4% (n=39) raised money online. Data also revealed that 66.7% of the business schools that raised money online reported that the average size of an individual online gift was $250 or less, and nearly 80% of the respondents claimed that online donations accounted for 10% or less of the total amount they received in annual donations. This study also explored other variables such as the type of institution (public or private) that accepted online donations as well as the type of fundraising office a business school had (decentralized, centralized, or combined). Donor characteristics and marketing strategies used by business schools to promote their online fundraising programs were also examined. The results revealed that many business schools did not accurately track the demographics and characteristics of their online donors. Findings from this study indicated that advancements in technology have increased the opportunities for obtaining financial support to business schools. The results can be used as a benchmark for future investigations.

However, while valuable Web resources provide unprecedented learning opportunities, easy access to information does not guarantee learning. Previous research has found that middle school students tend to use the Web in a superficial manner. To address the challenges that students face in online inquiry, this study explored several supporting strategies implemented in Digital IdeaKeeper, a scaffolded software tool to help students move from passively finding a ready-made answer to actively making sense of the information they encounter through support for inquiry planning, information search, analysis, and synthesis. This study examined the differences and similarities between regular online inquiry and supported online inquiry performed by several sixth-graders in real classroom settings. Four pairs from a sixth grade class used IdeaKeeper for their online inquiry project, and another four pairs from a different sixth grade class taught by the same teacher used regular online search engines only. Both groups worked on the same science topic-water, and the entire project lasted about four weeks. During that time, students in both groups used computers for about 10-14 days to conduct online research. Multiple sources of data were collected, including video recordings of students' computer activities and conversations, students' artifacts, log files and student final writings. Several themes emerged from the data analysis. First, the findings refer to the importance of providing a structure for students' online inquiry, to promote a more integrated, efficient, continuous, metacognitive and engaging online inquiry. In addition, guidance is important to promote more careful, thorough, and purposeful online reading, Overall, the results suggest that middle school students' online inquiry needs to be structured and their online reading needs to be guided. However, challenges still remain to engage students in high-level critical thinking in online inquiry, because some prompts designed to guide students' reading do not seem effective. Implications of the research findings are discussed.

No one has addressed whether participation in these programs are advantageous during the STEM faculty hiring process, however. This study sought to address this gap. I examined the value placed on participation in these programs by STEM faculty search committee chairpersons during the pre-interview stages of the hiring process within the context of the last search they chaired. This was accomplished in two ways. First, I conducted an archival search of The Chronicle of Higher Education and collected data on 1387 tenure-track, assistant professor level STEM job postings from across academia. I used analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD post hoe tests to look for differences between teaching duties mentioned and for requirements of statements/evidence of teaching. Second, I invited 705 of the STEM faculty search committee chairpersons identified in the Chronicle search to take a quantitative 20-question survey online of which 206 participated. Participants were first asked about themselves and their institutions as well as the context of the last search they chaired. Participants were then asked to evaluate the teaching credentials of different pairings of fictional candidates' vita and to rank order five fictional candidates with varying credentials within the context of the last search they chaired. I performed chi-square tests to evaluate the two fictional candidate comparison responses and a combination of Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA tests and Mann-Whitney U-tests to evaluate responses to the five candidate rank order question. The findings indicate that STEM search committee chairpersons place value on formal teacher training experiences, although the value given is dependent on many different factors. My findings also revealed that the value chairpersons placed on FTPP participation was dependent on a range of different factors including STEM discipline, institution type, whether postdoctoral experience was required, the experience level of the chairperson, and expectation of time commitments to research and teaching.

"INMV825H","thesis","2008","Finlay, Cory A.","Scene recognition: Testing the spatial updating hypothesis","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/621721634?accountid=14026","The goal of the current studies is to investigate conditions in which locomotion about a scene automatically updates a person's representation of the scene to be spatially consistent with the person's perspective of the scene after moving. A review of the spatial updating literature revealed to us several possible factors that could contribute to observer movement leading to viewpoint independent recognition of scenes: range of angles between encoding and judging a scene, scene set size, and the length of retention between encoding and judging a scene. In Experiments la and 1b, participants memorized a scene (11-, and 10-objects) from a single perspective. Then, either the scene was rotated or the participants moved (0deg; to 360deg; in 40deg; and 36deg; increments) around the scene, and participants judged whether the inter-object distances had changed. Regardless of whether the scene was rotated or the observer moved, RT increased with greater angular distance between judged and encoded views. Then, in Experiment 2, we examined whether automatic spatial updating depends on the number of objects in a scene. Participants memorized 5- and 10-object scenes, then either the scene was rotated or the participants moved (0deg; to 180deg;) around the scene, and participants judged what object had moved. Regardless of the set size, RT increased with angular distance. Studies that found evidence of spatial updating have used short-term retention paradigms whereas in our previous studies we used a long-term retention paradigm. Thus, in Experiment 3 we examined short-term scene recognition with scenes of varying set sizes (4-, 6-, 8, and 10-objects). Participants briefly viewed (3 s) a scene on each trial and immediately either moved around the scene and made scene recognition judgments for observer movement trials or immediately made scene recognition judgments for scene movement trials. Regardless of set size, RT increased and accuracy decreased with increasing angular distance. Research suggests that a short delay (as brief as 10 s) between encoding a scene and moving might impair automatic spatial updating. Thus, in Experiment 4 we examined whether automatic spatial updating depends on scene retention duration by varying the time between encoding a scene and moving about a scene (0 s, 6 s, and 12 s). Regardless of the delay, accuracy decreased and RT increased with angular distance for both observer and scene movement. Research suggests that representations of scenes could be updated either offline, after a period of movement is completed utilizing enduring representation in long-term memory, or online by continually keep track of objects in the environment on a moment-to-moment basis. In Experiment 5 we compared offline and online spatial updating following movement around a 5-object scene. Scene recognition judgments showed viewpoint-dependent patterns for both groups, but the offline group performed significantly faster and more accurately than the online group, suggesting that reliance on egocentric representations when making scene recognition judgments does not always lead to enhanced recognition. Overall, our data show that observer movement does not automatically update representations of spatial layouts and raise important questions about the effects of duration limitations, encoding frames of reference, and encoding points of view on the automatic spatial updating of representations of scenes.

The study used a Semantic Differential Technique; developed by Osgood, Tannenbaum, and Succi in the 1950s and uses Likert-like scales to quantify respondents connotative or affective meaning towards concept prompts presented in an online survey. The study surveyed 967 full-time tenured faculty, full-time tenure track faculty, full-time lecturers/instructors, and part-time lecturers/instructors at 22 of the 23 CSU campuses between the 23rd of October and the 23rd of December 2004. There were 108 valid response sets to the survey invitation. The purpose of the study was to answer the following research questions: (1) What are the attitudes (affective meanings) of CSU College of Education (teacher preparation) faculty towards the concepts pertaining to electronic portfolios as high-stakes assessment tools? (2) To what extent, if at all, are there relationships between attitudes to specific concepts relating to the use of electronic portfolios as a high-stakes assessment tool? (3) To what extent are there differences between specific attitudes towards electronic portfolios and demographic data (gender, age range, years teaching, self use of electronic/traditional portfolios, college use of electronic/traditional portfolios, employment status)? The results indicate that while the respondents do not have negative attitudes towards electronic portfolios or the concepts associated with them, they do not view the concepts associated with high-stakes assessments, large-scale assessments, or mandatory implementation of electronic portfolios favorably. As the CSU system looks at implementing electronic portfolios on a system wide basis each campus will need to undergo significant cultural change if these implementations are to be successful. While the results are promising in terms of positive attitudes towards portfolios in general, it is anticipated that even with significant support from campus and system leadership that true organizational change will require a significant investment of time and resources.

The few studies on employee cynicism were mainly conducted in the fields of management and psychology. The role of communication in shaping employee cynicism was rarely highlighted. Using the theoretical framework of social information processing (SIP), this study explored the communication variables in the social context which contribute to employee cynicism toward organizational change in a higher education institution. In the model, the three variables reflecting the social context, specifically, perceived quality of information, cynicism of colleagues, trust in the administration, are hypothesized to predict change-specific cynicism, which in turn, leads to intention to resist change. Participation in decision making (PDM) is hypothesized to predict intention to resist change both directly and indirectly through the mediating role of change-specific cynicism. The research was conducted in a Midwestern university which was undergoing a comprehensive strategic planning process. An online survey was administered to all full time tenure track faculty in this university. Path analysis was used to test the overall model fit. The findings of the study suggest that the proposed model explained a significant amount of variance in the outcome variables. However, contrary to the theoretical assumptions, PDM did not have significant causal effects on the outcome variables. Based on the empirical data, the proposed model was revised. The revised model fit the empirical data under study and all path coefficients were statistically significant at the .05 level. The revised model suggests that perceived quality of information had the largest causal effect on change-specific cynicism, followed by cynicism of colleagues, and finally trust in administration. Change-specific cynicism explained 79% of the variance in intention to resist change. The results of the study support SIP theory by indicating that change-specific cynicism emerges from the work environment. Future studies are called for to explore cynicism from the communication perspective. Further, more research should be conducted to investigate employee cynicism in the changing higher education environment. This study has significant practical implications for administrators in higher education institutions.

Establishing user requirements is essential to any systems development effort. This study examines the most fundamental sort of user requirement: understanding who the user is as an individual and how that identity informs the user's expectations and experiences. This research aims to provide insight into the nature of Personal Health Records (PHR) system users by taking an inductive approach to classifying them and describing their attributes in a formal taxonomy. In seeking both to understand and to classify, this project employs both an ontological approach to understanding the characteristics of users, and a taxonomic approach to classifying users in ways that are useful in meeting their specific needs. To develop this understanding, two methods are used in an iterative cycle: (1) in-depth interviews with potential PHR users selected as representative of the three main user groups hypothesized, the well, the unwell, and the disabled and (2) a quantitative survey of a larger methodically selected sample, that will test preliminary taxonomies arising from the qualitative interviews. The study indicates that there are specific, identifiable differences among the well, unwell, and disabled with respect to their healthcare information management preferences. These preferences can be traced directly to the difference in health status, rather than to, for example, a ""digital divide."" These results indicate that, contrary to the prevailing perception, people with disabilities and those with chronic illnesses are actually avid consumers of information management tools that aid them in taking care of themselves. Further, these results show that the disabled have strongly-held views about what they want from these systems. A factor that is fundamental to their thinking on PHR is the importance of emergency care. The most striking finding, however, is the high degree of preference among all user types for a portable, secure, device-based PHR that will always be available when needed. Convenience, reliability, and security appear to drive this preference. Given that the market default for PHR platform seems to be the internet, a re-thinking may be in order as a result of this study. The definite preference in PHR technology serves to divide the disabled from both the unwell and the well. Disabled individuals are enthusiastic about using technology, perhaps because it is a liberating force in otherwise constricted lifestyle. This attitude may make the community of disabled Americans a model one in which to test PHR design.

"P74ZWEPY","thesis","2008","Nightingale, Judi","Repeatability of serial carotid intima media thickness scanning on individual subjects","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/621752425?accountid=14026","Background. Heart disease affects millions of Americans each year. In order to improve primary prevention, early risk identification is essential. B-mode ultrasound of the common carotid artery (CCA) intima-media thickness (IMT) assesses risk of a coronary event early in the process of plaque development. Because IMT changes are so small over time, in order to determine clinically significant versus clinically insignificant changes in IMT over a 12 month time period, a protocol is needed which can detect the least significant difference (LSD) of at least 0.030 mm. Purpose. The purpose of this study was to develop and test a well-defined protocol for CCA IMT testing, using an edge detection software program, in order to reach this LSD goal. Methodology. Using a repeated measures study design, 26 subjects were scanned over four weeks, one session a week for a total of four separate sessions. Three operators performed scanning at the first session and two operators at the following three sessions on each subject. Operators obtained far wall measurements of a 10 mm section of IMT, centered at five mm proximal to the bulb. Images were recorded from two angles of both the right and left CCA. Six measures (three with EKG gating and three without), were recorded per angle for a total of 24 per subject or 2,400 total images. Analysis. Analysis of data using generalizability theory was performed to determine the optimal number of sessions, measurements, operators and machines and to assess whether a LSD of at least 0.030 mm can be detected. Data were also analyzed to determine whether the max or the mean IMT has a higher repeatability estimate and whether EKG gating is a significant factor in repeatability of IMT images. Generalizability coefficients were computed using seven facets [session, replication (one measure-three were taken per angle), angle, machine (instrument), readings (measurements), operator, and reader] and interactions of each. Four more generalizability coefficients were computed based on EKG gating and whether max or mean IMT values were used. Significance to preventive care. IMT scanning is useful in the identification of subclinical atherosclerotic disease risk. The ability to track and assess the efficacy of prescribed measures intended to reduce cardiovascular disease risk can also be accomplished with IMT scanning. Results. The percentage of error variance for mean, non-gated IMT values showed results of the 16 variance components comprised of the seven facets and their interactions. The greatest contributors to measurement error were machine (16.79%), and the following interactions: subject*operator (13.29%), subject*session (11.2%), and subject*machine (6.95%). If one operator uses only one model machine to acquire three images from each of two specific angles (both left and right sides, 12 images), and the same operator scans the same subject in the same way the next time (within 4 weeks), then the same reader measures the IMT images twice, one can expect IMT results will be within 96.5% of the first IMT value, 90% of the time. At maximal standardization, non-EKG gating provides consistently superior LSD and reproducibility over EKG gating. In this study, a LSD of 0.030mm was detected. There was a significant difference when using two different model ultrasound scanners for serial tracking of individuals; one consistent model of machine is recommended. Conclusion. Based on results of this study, when performing serial carotid ultrasounds, it is important to use a consistent model of ultrasound machine. EKG gating does not improve repeatability. Use of IMT promises to be a useful noninvasive measurement which will allow practitioners to identify subclinical atherosclerotic disease risk and to track and assess the efficacy of prescribed measures aimed at reducing the amount of cardiovascular disease risk in those who are at high risk.

The purpose of the current study was to examine the degree of agreement that existed between 121 adolescent-parents pairs, or dyads, in terms of Internet use, perception of use, and regulation. Data was obtained using two parallel web-based surveys. Parents and adolescents agreed when it came to the location that the adolescent accesses the Internet, how often the adolescent uses the Internet for general purposes (talk with friends, meet new people, look things up for school, research a product, listen to music, or play games), how often the adolescent uses various technology tools (MySpace, e-mail, IM, Google, and LiveJournal), MySpace account use, the frequency of adolescent use in a normal week, adolescent skill level, adolescent risk behaviors (MySpace profile settings, having unmet ""friends,"" and personal identity management), adolescent cyber-bullying experience (both as participant and target), and methods of regulation (filters, monitoring software, safety discussions, and establishing rules). This unexpected agreement in use and regulation contradicted both the hypothesis that differences would be found, and challenged the current research in this area. The high reported levels of adolescent autonomy and autonomy support helped to explain this agreement. Parents and adolescents also agreed in their reported degree of adolescent rule following. This additional area of agreement, along with the relationship that was established between rule following and all three indicators of autonomy support, reinforced this explanation. Parents and adolescents generally disagreed when it came to perceptions of the Internet in areas such as safety on the Internet, freedom and choice, and the personal/private nature of the Internet. This was consistent with the hypothesis that differences would be found in these areas. While supervising the Internet is largely out of the school's jurisdiction, school districts should continue to provide parents with the help and support that they need to act as the first educators in the home. Future study is recommended with a larger and more diverse sample population. Additionally, further studies that incorporate mixed methods designs with observable measures are also recommended.

E-coaching, conducted partially or entirely at a distance, offers convenience, cost-savings, efficiency, and improved access to people and resources. However, research on e-coaching for work-related purposes is limited. This descriptive and exploratory study used mixed methods to examine e-coaching extent, technologies and practices, and factors that influence deployment and success in organizations. A web-based survey gathered opinions from over two hundred workforce learning and performance professionals. Semi-structured interviews gathered critical incidents from twenty e-coaches. The researcher used Chi-square, analyses of variance, and regression analyses to examine differences by e-coaching level and the influence of individual, organization, and innovation factors. Data showed that most coaching was delivered with little technology, with strong expectations for growth despite weak perceptions of coaching success and organizational support. E-coaching was more typically used as an alternative to face-to-face rather than as an opportunity to do something altogether new, and typically used to serve geographically dispersed employees, provide just-in-time support, address issues of scheduling, provide greater access to expertise and multiple perspectives, and reduce costs. E-coaching involved mostly e-mail, land line telephone, and sharing electronic files, with limited use of video conferencing, and was typically part of a formal and blended learning and development initiative rather than an ad hoc or standalone activity. Certain coaching purposes, topics, and beliefs about e-coaching usefulness as well as a supportive environment were strong predictors of e-coaching level, technology choices, and perceived efficacy. Coaches valued relative advantage, compatibility, and familiarity over media richness, and they used technology-based tools to increase presence, humanize the experience, connect proteges to peers and resources, and track client progress. Many respondents felt that face-to-face contact was necessary for sensitive feedback, physical interactions, or addressing deeper issues. Group and just-in-time coaching received enthusiasm which supports the importance of learning by doing and on-demand resources. Findings converge with the literature and suggest several practical implications for organizations, individual coaches, and others interested in the effective design, support, and implementation of e-coaching for development and performance support.

MMOGs are believed to hold significant promise for educators because they provide for the player (learner) rich learning opportunities that exemplify quality-learning experiences but there is little empirical research and published work on MMOGs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of collaborative problem solving during MMOG play on the individual achievement (posttest and concept-map construction scores) of 159 sixth-grade students. There were four comparison groups of existing, intact sixth-grade classes (n=100): two taught by the researcher and two taught by the regular sixth-grade science teacher and an experimental group of two existing, intact sixth-grade classes (n=59) taught by the researcher. During the 8-day investigation, the experimental group played Web Earth Online, an ecology-based MMOG, and the comparison group received traditional instruction that included multimedia-rich, hands-on, collaborative activities to learn about the life cycle and survival needs of the Eastern Bluebird. A content analysis of the log files of player dialog to assess player collaborative teamwork during MMOG play was utilized. A dependent-samples t test and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to examine the differences in performance between the experimental and comparison groups on the content knowledge assessment and concept-map construction task. A correlation of frequencies was utilized to examine the relationship between collaborative teamwork-strategy scores of students in the MMOG group and posttest and concept-map scores. Satisfaction surveys were administered to examine game and unit satisfaction. Results of the analysis showed that individuals who participated in the experimental group tended to have statistically significant lower posttest scores than students in the comparison group taught by the researcher (based on the 33-item test results) or in the comparison group taught by the teacher (based on the more reliable 17-item test results). Although no statistically significant differences were found in the scores from the experimental group, a statistically significant difference between pre- and posttest was found for the whole sample. Descriptive statistics indicated that learning growth occurred in both groups as evidenced by the pre-and posttest difference in means. Moreover, nonsignificant differences among the three groups in terms of concept-map scores were observed. An analysis of the chat log files of the MMOG participants revealed that only 30% of the chats involved collaboration, with the more common strategies being Communication, Leadership, and Interpersonal. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between usage of Leadership strategies and posttest scores. Findings from correlation results show that there is a high degree of interitem correlation between the collaborative strategies identified for the study from the chat log files of the experimental group. The percentage of responses of agree and strongly agree that participants learned from the MMOG and the instructional unit are 82%, 58%, and 75% for experimental, researcher's comparison, and teacher's comparison, respectively, with the experimental students overwhelmingly indicated they learned about the Eastern Bluebird. The findings from this study suggested that the educational use of video games, specifically MMOGs, can be a viable pedagogical strategy. Results indicated that Web Earth Online was engaging and motivating for students and that the study indicated that concept maps are appropriate instruments to measure learning in a MMOG.

Because anyone with an email account is a potential victim, organizations need to provide information to consumers and research needs to be done to track the effectiveness of a consumer training program. To address this problem, this research study sought to determine if consumer education was a solution by exploring if specific characteristics (age, gender, education, knowledge of phishing or online habits) impact a participant's ability to correctly identify email messages. Quantitative data was collected by showing participants ten email messages and quizzing their ability to correctly categorize the messages. The impact age, gender, education, knowledge of phishing and online habits had on their ability to identify the emails was measured. The results were used to determine that these variables did influence the participant's ability to correctly identify email messages. This information may later be used to assist in training on a larger scale and not just be limited to identity theft and phishing.

Method: 187 non-sleep-deprived college students from Baruch College completed a 1- hour computer assessment which included eight tasks: general sleep questionnaire, sleep diary, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, Profile of Mood States, reaction time task, Math Effort Task, and non-academic task selection question. Results: Principal components analysis was used to identify 8 factors and form composite variables. Those factors were entered into hierarchical regressions to predict effort. Objective effort, but not subjectively rated effort, could be predicted and was most related to actual sleep and perceived energy. 10% of the variance of objective effort was accounted for by actual sleep, perceived energy, reaction time and interactions among these components. Conclusions: Under non-sleep-deprived sleep conditions, objectively measured effort is affected by previous night's sleep and perceived energy. Objectively measured and subjectively rated effort, however, derive from different sources. The potential danger of reduced energy caused by even minimal sleep loss is that less effort may be applied in situations where maximal effort is expected or needed. Future research may clarify the mechanisms by which sleep affects effort and the effects of accumulated sleep loss on effort.

Poor adherence to exercise and diet are cited as major barriers to losing weight. Although motivational coaching, personalized feedback and patient education are effective tools, to deliver all these elements using traditional methods requires a level of manpower that is both costly and in short supply, leaving many patients without access. In order to address this problem we developed an automated coaching platform designed to provide personalized feedback to change behavior. The platform has two key components: a wearable activity monitor and a computer avatar designed to provide exercise coaching. The activity monitor tracks daily step totals and can be worn in a number of different locations on the body (on belt, in pocket, around neck), allowing it to be a ‘wear and forget’ device. The monitor transmits information about a patient’s daily activity level through a ""black box"" console to a computer server. The step counts are then sent to the ‘Virtual Coach’; an animated, embodied computer agent designed to run on a patient’s home computer. The coach uses verbal and non-verbal relationship building behavior to create an effective working alliance with a patient, offering educational information, feedback on performance and strategies to overcome barriers. By creating interoperability between the coach and the activity monitor, we allowed interactions to be tailored to the patient’s step count. This platform offers patients access to scaleable, low-cost personalized coaching. This is a valuable form of motivational support to help overweight patients improve their adherence to an exercise regime. Furthermore, by basing the coaching interactions on measured step counts we eliminate the common errors seen when patients self report this information. We believe this platform offers an effective approach to increasing patient activity and positively impacting overall health.

Thus said, it is important to optimise their operation in order to consistently achieve products of high quality while minimising the production of undesirables. In processes like polymerisation, these reactors are responsible for a greater number of products than other reactor types and the need for optimal operation is therefore greater. An approach based on an offline dynamic optimisation and online control strategy is used in this work to generate optimal set point profiles for the batch polymerisation of methyl methacrylate. Dynamic optimisation is carried out from which controller set points to attain desired polymer molecular end point characteristics are achieved. Temperature is the main variable to be controlled, and this is done over finite discrete intervals of time. For on-line control, we evaluate the performance of neural networks in two controllers used to track the derived optimal set points for the system. The controllers are generic model control (GMC), ([P.L. Lee, G.R. Sullivan, Generic model control, Comput. Chem. Eng. 12(6) (1998) 573-580]) and the neural network-based inverse model-based control (IMBC), ([M.A. Hussain, L.S. Kershenbaum, Implementation of an inverse model based control strategy using neural networks on a partially simulated exothermic reactor, Trans. IchemE 78(A) (2000) 299-311]). Although the GMC is a model-based controller, neural networks are used to estimate the heat release within its framework for on-line control. Despite the application of these two controllers to general batch reactors, no published work exists on their application to batch polymerisation in the literature. In this work, the performance of the neural networks within each controller's algorithm for tracking and setpoint regulation of the optimal trajectory and in robustness tests on the system is evaluated.

Determining the relationship between the extent of programme coverage and its impact (i.e., reductions in disease risk or incidence) is complicated by the lack of controlled trials with cohorts of drug users and instead has to be estimated by imputation, mathematical modelling, or ecological data analysis. This report offers an approach to determine community-wide impact and discusses the limitations of that approach. Methods: Easily created programme tracking data were maintained by exchanges in New Haven, CT, USA and Chicago, IL, USA. Data compiled by month quantified the number of unique participants visiting syringe-exchange programmes and the number of syringes distributed. ""Coverage"", defined either as the percentage of individuals reached or percentage of community syringe need met, was estimated by incorporating measures of the size of the injector population or injection frequency. These measures of coverage are placed in the context of changing programme operations to estimate the effect of these changes on coverage. Finally, data on AIDS cases from New Haven and Chicago were used to estimate the community-wide impact of syringe exchange. Results: Two mobile syringe-exchange programmes operated with very different exchange policies. Programme data revealed that coverage of individuals rarely exceeded 10% and was higher in New Haven than in Chicago. On the other hand, coverage measured as the percentage of syringe need met was higher at the Chicago exchange that employed the less restrictive policy. The impact of syringe exchange in the two cities was measured by comparing subsequent AIDS cases. The relative reduction in injection-related AIDS cases as a function of all new AIDS diagnoses was 21.7% in New Haven and 41.4% in Chicago. Conclusions: A modest investment in the collection of programme data can yield reliable and interpretable information on the extent of programme reach and retention. Limitations to the approach result from the ecological nature of the data and from the need to use data from outside the programme that may be less reliable. For the cases presented here, coverage rates will vary as a function of the programme policies; however, even modest coverage rates - well below those recommended by UNAIDS - can have significant impacts on HIV epidemics. Restrictive policies appeared to increase the coverage if measured only by the proportion of monthly participants and not by the proportion of syringe need met by a programme. More generally, programmes can collect programmatic data and some rapid assessment data (estimates of IDU population and injection frequency) to estimate of the impact of their programmes.

Methods: Randomized trial conducted from May 2003 to December 2004 at one community health center in Wilmington, NC. A total of 236 women, ages 40-64, were randomized to receive an Enhanced Intervention (EI) or Minimal Intervention (MI). The EI consisted of an intensive phase (6 months) including 2 individual counseling sessions, 3 group sessions, and 3 phone calls from a peer counselor followed by a maintenance phase (6 months) including 1 individual counseling session and 7 monthly peer counselor calls. Both phases included efforts to increase participants' use of community resources that promote positive lifestyle change. The MI consisted of a one-time mailing of pamphlets on diet and PA. Outcomes, measured at 6 and 12 months, included the comparison of moderate intensity PA between study groups as assessed by accelerometer (primary outcome) and questionnaire, and dietary intake assessed by questionnaire and serum carotenoids (6 months only). Results: For accelerometer outcomes, follow-up was 75% at 6 months and 73% at 12 months. Though moderate intensity PA increased in the EI and decreased in the MI, the difference between groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.45; multivariate model, p = 0.08); however, moderate intensity PA assessed by questionnaire (92% follow-up at 6 months and 75% at 12 months) was greater in the EI (p = 0.01; multivariate model, p = 0.001). For dietary outcomes, follow-up was 90% for questionnaire and 92% for serum carotenoids at 6 months and 74% for questionnaire at 12 months. Dietary intake improved more in the EI compared to the MI (questionnaire at 6 and 12 months, p < 0.001; serum carotenoid index, p = 0.05; multivariate model, p = 0.03). Conclusion: The EI did not improve objectively measured PA, but was associated with improved self-reported and objective measures of dietary intake.

Relative to other studies of college students, a lower percentage of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) student-athletes reported gambling (males 62.4%, females 43%) and having gambling problems (males 4.3%, females 0.4%), but a high prevalence of weekly gambling was reported (males 13.0%, females 3.3%). Male student-athletes in high profile sports (e.g., baseball, football) were more likely to report a gambling-related problem compared to their counterparts in other sports (e.g., track & field, volleyball). Sports wagering remains a cause for concern. Only a very small number of student athletes reported major infractions such as attempting to alter the outcome of a game or sharing inside information. Future research should investigate why certain student-athletes are more prone to develop gambling problems.

To examine this question, political ad tracking data were combined with a national daily survey collected during the 2000 election campaign cycle. The resulting ad volume data and individual communication behavior by geographic location and date allowed examination of how political advertising contexts influenced citizen communication. Results show that, in response to an influx of local political advertising, people sought more political information through television news programs, the Internet, and social networks.

Parents implement a range of strategies, favoring active co-use and interaction rules over technical restrictions using filters or monitoring software, but these were not necessarily effective in reducing risk. Parental restriction of online peer-to-peer interactions was associated with reduced risk but other mediation strategies, including the widely practiced active co-use, were not.

Among the 1027 articles published in these journals from 2001 to 2005, 444 articles were identified as being related to the topic of cognition in e-learning. These articles were cross analyzed by published years, journal, research topic, and citation count. Furthermore, 16 highly-cited articles across different topics were chosen for further analysis according to their research settings, participants, research design types, and research methods. It was found from the analysis of the 444 articles that ""Instructional Approaches,"" ""Learning Environment,"" and ""Metacognition"" were the three most popular research topics, but the analysis of the citation counts suggested that the studies related to ""Instructional Approaches,"" ""Information Processing"" and ""Motivation"" might have a greater impact on subsequent research. Although the use of questionnaires might still be the main method of gathering research data in e-learning cognitive studies, a clear trend was observed that more and more studies were utilizing learners' log files or online messages as data sources for analysis. The results of the analysis provided insights for educators and researchers into research trends and patterns of cognition in e-learning.

The first is a longitudinal follow-up program that targets and tracks the development of infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units. The second approach is designed to identify children with neuromotor delays from birth to 36 months by testing the validity of a new screening measure and comparing traditional and online instructional techniques to teach professionals how to use the instrument. The third approach is a community-based, universal, developmental screening project that also examines the impact of this project on the community's capacity for early identification and intervention with young children. The article reports on the goals, objectives, research questions, methodology, and early results of these 3 approaches. These approaches are part of a larger collaborative interdisciplinary, ecological, community/university research initiative studying early child development in British Columbia, Canada. Drawing on a wide range of university-based health, medical, and social science researchers working in close collaboration with community-based early intervention programs, the article discusses the 3 approaches as points along a continuum of longitudinal follow-up, targeted, and universal screening early identification programs and also examines the value added of conducting these studies under the umbrella of one overall program of research. On the basis of the findings of the 3 studies, we propose an integrated framework for the surveillance, screening, and early identification of young children.

However, the lack of tools supporting the authoring and automatic checking of exercises for specifics topics (e.g., geometry) drastically reduces advantages in the use of e-learning environments on a larger scale, as usually happens in Brazil. This paper describes an algorithm, and a tool based on it, designed for the authoring and automatic checking of geometry exercises. The algorithm dynamically compares the distances between the geometric objects of the student's solution and the template's solution, provided by the author of the exercise. Each solution is a geometric construction which is considered a function receiving geometric objects (input) and returning other geometric objects (output). Thus, for a given problem, if we know one function (construction) that solves the problem, we can compare it to any other function to check whether they are equivalent or not. Two functions are equivalent if, and only if, they have the same output when the same input is applied. If the student's solution is equivalent to the template's solution, then we consider the student's solution as a correct solution. Our software utility provides both authoring and checking tools to work directly on the Internet, together with learning management systems. These tools are implemented using the dynamic geometry software, iGeom, which has been used in a geometry course since 2004 and has a successful track record in the classroom. Empowered with these new features, iGeom simplifies teachers' tasks, solves non-trivial problems in student solutions and helps to increase student motivation by providing feedback in real time.

Sveningsson (see record 2008-13606-008) regarding informed consent and privacy in qualitative internet research. How one defines privacy and/or private information, as Malin Sveningsson clearly articulates in her essay, has consequences for the types of procedures researchers will follow. In particular, she notes, that researchers must determine if it is necessary to gain research participants' informed consent for a study to be executed ethically. Sveningsson's chapter is valuable because it comprehensively identifies the diverse factors that affect conceptions of privacy. Moreover, it wisely repositions the relationship between ""public"" and ""private"" as continuous rather than dichotomous. The present author's experiences studying teenagers' internet usage lead her to agree wholeheartedly with Sveningsson's conclusion that for researchers seeking to know how privacy issues should guide their decision making about informed consent agreements, the best response is ""it all depends."" Nevertheless, there are some important considerations, beyond how one defines privacy, that provide useful guidelines as one endeavors to do qualitative internet research.

The primary aim of the present study was to determine the effects of incremental running until exhaustion on sensorimotor performance and adaptation in a tracking task. Subjects were randomly assigned to a running group (RG), a tracking group (TG), or a running followed by tracking group (RTG), with 10 subjects assigned to each group. Treadmill running velocity was initially set at 2.0 m s − 1, increasing by 0.5 m s − 1 every 5 min until exhaustion. Tracking consisted of 35 episodes (each 40 s) where the subjects' task was to track a visual target on a computer screen while the visual feedback was veridical (performance) or left-right reversed (adaptation). Resting electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded before and after each experimental condition (running, tracking, rest). Tracking performance and the final amount of adaptation did not differ between groups. However, task adaptation was significantly faster in RTG compared to TG. In addition, increased alpha and beta power were observed following tracking in TG but not RTG although exhaustive running failed to induce significant changes in these frequency bands. Our results suggest that exhaustive running can facilitate adaptation processes in a manual tracking task. Attenuated cortical activation following tracking in the exercise condition was interpreted to indicate cortical efficiency and exercise-induced facilitation of selective central processes during actual task demands.

In addition to lending a quantitative aspect to characterizing a person's level of dementia and cognitive functioning, neuropsychological assessment provides information regarding specific cognitive strengths and weaknesses and allows for comparison of cognitive patterns across disorders, thereby assisting with differential diagnosis. Serial neuropsychological examinations extend the utility of baseline or diagnostic cognitive assessment by providing data used to track areas of cognitive change over time, chart the rate of progression, plan treatment, and make recommendations for behavioral and environmental adaptations. Neuropsychological testing is an accepted medical diagnostic procedure (Current Procedural Terminology codes 96118 to 96120) (American Medical Association 2006), and one of the primary indications for neurocognitive evaluation is dementia (Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee 1996). The neuropsychological evaluation includes the administration of standardized neurocognitive tests. Such measures reflect behavioral samples of cognitive function that tap various brain-related abilities and, indirectly, their underlying neural systems. Test development relies on principles from psychology, neurology, neuroscience, and related fields. Most current measures involve pencil-and-paper and question-answer types of tasks, whereas others include manipulation of various test stimuli and may involve computer-based tasks. Neuropsychological tests are carefully developed, with highly standardized instructions and scoring criteria. Rigorous standardization and sound psychometric properties are hallmarks of neuropsychological testing.

Although observable activity is a core aspect of behavior, assessment strategies have tended to focus on emotional, cognitive, or physiological responses. When physical activity is assessed, it is done so mostly with questionnaires. Converging evidence of only a moderate association between self-reports of physical activity and objectively measured physical activity does raise questions about the validity of these self-reports. Ambulatory activity monitoring, defined as the measurement strategy to assess physical activity, posture, and movement patterns continuously in everyday life, has made major advances over the last decade and has considerable potential for further application in the assessment of observable activity, a core aspect of behavior. With new piezoresistive sensors and advanced computer algorithms, the objective measurement of physical activity, posture, and movement is much more easily achieved and measurement precision has improved tremendously. With this overview, we introduce to the reader some recent developments in ambulatory activity monitoring. We will elucidate the discrepancies between objective and subjective reports of activity, outline recent methodological developments, and offer the reader a framework for developing insight into the state of the art in ambulatory activity-monitoring technology, discuss methodological aspects of time-based design and psychometric properties, and demonstrate recent applications. Although not yet main stream, ambulatory activity monitoring—especially in combination with the simultaneous assessment of emotions, mood, or physiological variables—provides a comprehensive methodology for psychology because of its suitability for explaining behavior in context.

It was designed based on a mixed method. The quantitative method was conducted to determine the attitudes and barriers by using computer technology among track and field officials and the subjects involved with 135 track and field officials who participated in the Chinese Taipei International Athletic Meet in Tainan City on May 29-30, 2008. A total of 101 responded for an effective response rate of 74.8%. An quantitative instrument included demographics and the Attitudes Toward Computer Technology Scale in Chinese version (ACT). Barriers in the Use of Computer Technology in Chinese version (BUC) was used as the research tool. The data were analyzed with descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations, and percentage), t-test, MANOVA, and Bonferroni. The .05 level of significance was used for all statistical analysis. Furthermore, fifteen officials who have experience serving as chief officials and who participated in this championship were selected for a further face-to-face interview with a formal and semi-structured format. The qualitative method was designed to explore the needs of information technology. A significant difference was found between professions and the set of comfort/anxiety. Analysis showed that the age groups of 21-30 and 31-40 had stronger feelings of comfortable in the use of computer technology than the age group of 60 up. Furthermore, the findings indicated that the officials who have a master's degree had more comfortable feelings about using computer technology than those with a junior college degree. The results determined 7 factors as either barriers or facilitators in the use of computer technology, including administration, training, software, support, time, equipment, and facilitator. Most of 15 track and field officials who participated in the following interviews indicated that the existing systems such as registration system, distance measurement system, starting system, photo finish system, wind gauge system, and recording system should be connected with each other to replace the traditional delivery approach—paper and pencil. However, a recording system of track events for judging should be developed to complete the information technology in the professional area of track and field. Finally, the track and field officials have strong positive attitudes toward computer technology, feel comfortable using computer technology, and see technology as a useful tool.

What are the patterns of their disclosure in online support groups? What individual characteristics predict these disclosure patterns? In what ways does written disclosure in online groups lead to potential health benefits? By answering these questions, this research provides a theoretical framework for the patterns, predictors, and influences of written disclosure in online support groups. This research involved a secondary analysis of data which were collected originally as a part of Digital Divide Pilot Project (Gustafson et al., 2005a, 2005b). Low-income women with breast cancer were recruited and given access to bulletin-board-type online groups. Three sets of data were analyzed: baseline and four-month follow-up surveys assessing participants' ( N = 231) background characteristics and health outcomes, a set of messages posted in the online groups during the four-month period, and log data that saved the occurrences of message posting and reading. Findings showed large individual variances in the behavior of posting disclosive messages in terms of both the quantity and the content of posts. The patterns of disclosure were predicted primarily by ethnicity and age. Data supported the positive associations between disclosure in online groups and health benefits at follow-up, mainly in a subset of active posters who wrote two or more disclosive messages. Insightful disclosure led to greater improvements in health self-efficacy, emotional well-being, and functional well-being, mediated by lowered breast cancer concerns. Negative emotional disclosure weakened the negative relations between concerns and functional well-being. Supportive disclosure also produced favorable benefits, such that providing support to other women at least in a part of disclosive messages was related to greater improvements in functional well-being and concerns; expressing gratitude for received support in disclosure was associated with greater improvements in health self-efficacy and concerns. However, the hypothesis about the lagged reciprocity of disclosure (i.e., the extent to which individuals reciprocate by posting after they read insightful or emotional expressions in other women's disclosures) was not supported. Overall the findings suggest a theoretical framework to study self-disclosure in online support groups considering both the intrapersonal and interpersonal aspects of written disclosure.

A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used in the current study – surveys assessed the prevalence of academic stress and adolescent distress, and interviews with 12 th standard students explored their perceptions of the issue and their understanding of the role of parents. In the survey part of the study, the prevalence of the problem was assessed with the use of scales that measured depression and anxiety. Surveys were completed by 12 th standard students ( n = 588) from the south Indian city of Chennai. A majority of students reported that they were stressed by the coming school year, and rates of depression and anxiety were very high in the sample. In contrast with previous research and contrary to expectations, few gender, academic track and school type differences were found. Further analyses indicated that different groups of students appeared to experience distress in different ways. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 th standard students ( n = 24) to explore their perceptions of academic stress and adolescent distress. Their perceptions could be categorized into six themes: busy schedules, experience of stress, somatic symptoms, attitudes and beliefs about 12 th standard, the role of God vs. hard work, and education reform. The same interview data was also used to understand the role of parents. Analysis suggested that parents were involved in their child’s education in five ways – they had specific expectations for achievement, they put pressure on their children, they compared their child to others, they controlled the study environment, and they were supportive of their children. Some categories appeared to be associated with a greater experience of academic stress and adolescent distress than others. The interview data was also explored for gender, academic track, and school type differences. Jointly, these findings suggest that academic stress and adolescent distress is indeed a significant problem in Chennai, India. A variety of interventions are suggested to address the issue.

This project assesses the technocultural impact of software that automatically produces and dynamically adapts content to user input through a case study analysis of amazon.com and of the MediaWiki software package. It offers an interdisciplinary theoretical framework that borrows from communication studies (discourse analysis, medium theory, cultural studies of technology), from new media studies (software criticism) and from Actor-network theory and Felix Guattari's mixed semiotics. In so doing, the research defines a new methodological framework through which the question of semiotics and discourse can be analyzed thanks to an exploration of the technocultural conditions that create communicative possibilities. The analysis of amazon.com examines how the deployment of tools to track, shape and predict the cultural desires of users raises questions related to the imposition of specific modes of interpretation. In particular, I highlight the process through which user-produced meanings are incorporated within software-produced semiotic systems so as to embed cultural processes within a commercial imperative. While amazon.com is an instance of the commercial use of dynamic content production techniques on the Web, Wikipedia stands as a symbol of non-commercial knowledge production. The Wikipedia model is not only cultural, but also technical as mass collaborative knowledge production depends on a suite of software tools - the MediaWiki architecture - that enables new discursive practices. The Wikipedia model is the result of a set of articulations between technical and cultural processes, and the case study examines how this model is captured, modified and challenged by other websites using the same wiki architecture as Wikipedia.

"857LTCSP","thesis","2009","Grygolec, Jaroslaw","Neuroeconomics of social decisions","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/622064406?accountid=14026","This dissertation is about how social comparisons leading to envy and pride impact decisions. We, humans, may feel envious and proud for different reasons. One view is that comparing our performance with others' can give us a useful signal about our productivity and skill, and then envy and pride just help us to learn from such experience. The other plausible view is that envy and pride may reflect changes in social status, where dominance in social group is the ultimate objective. In Chapter 1 we report the results of fMRI experiment in which subjects faced simple decision problem in both private and social environments without strategic interactions. The analysis of behavioral and neural data provides evidence for subjects performing social comparisons exhibiting envy and pride while evaluating outcomes of decisions. This effect is even stronger if decision-makers bear relatively more responsibility for the resulting difference in outcomes. In Chapters 2 and 3 we explore social comparisons in strategic situations focusing on 3-person ultimatum game, first in purely behavioral and then in fMRI experiments. In the former we find evidence for responders exhibiting envy and pride. In Chapter 3 we focused on neural basis of rejections of low but positive amounts of money by responders. We show that the involvement of negative emotions in rejections of such low but positive offers is not due to their unfairness, but rather reflects negative reputational signal that the actual acceptance can send to others about the responder. Finally, we implicated nucleus accumbens in the decision process behind responders' decision on low but positive offers. This is an area, shown elsewhere to track subjective value of rewards, and that exhibited envy and pride effects documented in chapter 1. From the methodological standpoint Chapters 1 and 3 show how an economist can test an economic model on both behavioral and neural data. Such tests of economic theory are more credible in our view despite the necessity of making additional assumptions related to the use of neural data.

"C69CC2NI","thesis","2009","Carr, Lucas J.","Short and long-term efficacy of an internet-delivered physical activity behavior change program on physical activity and cardiometabolic disease risk factors in sedentary, overweight adults","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/622067706?accountid=14026","Physical inactivity and obesity are primary risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases. Reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress along with upregulation of antioxidant enzyme capacity represent promising mechanisms for the reductions in cardiometabolic disease risk. Evidence supports an inverse, dose-response relationship between PA and cardiometabolic disease risk. Improved levels of inflammation, oxidative stress, and antioxidant enzyme capacity may be achievable through low-intensity, habitual PA. Lifestyle-oriented, internet-delivered PA behavior change programs such as Active Living Every Day (ALED-I), which are often of low intensity and focused on reducing physical inactivity, represent a promising medium for cardiometabolic disease risk reduction. The specific aims of the three studies in this dissertation are: (1) to determine whether the 16-week ALED-I internet-delivered PA behavior change program is as efficacious as previously validated approaches, including classroom-delivered programs and traditional individualized exercise prescription programs; (2) to determine whether the ALED-I program increases PA and improves cardiometabolic disease risk factors in a sedentary, overweight/obese, rural adult cohort; (3) to determine whether accrued and anticipated short-term improvements in PA and cardiometabolic disease risk factors following the ALED-I program are maintained long-term in sedentary, overweight/obese rural adults; and (4) to determine whether the ALED-I program elicits cardiometabolic disease protection through reduced inflammation and oxidative stress and increased antioxidant enzyme capacity. The primary findings from the three studies in this dissertation are that the ALED-I increased PA by an average of 1,384 steps/day ( p=0.03) compared to 816 steps/day ( p=0.14) for the control group. Triglycerides (161±16 vs. 108±14; p=0.01) and waist circumference (100.6±2.4 vs. 96.6±2.7 cm; p=0.01) decreased in the ALED-I group and did not change in the control group (103±12 vs. 89±13; p=0.21) and (99.2±2.2 vs.99.8±2.1 cm; p=0.54), respectively. In the ALED-I intervention group there was no significant changes in percent change in waist circumference, BMI, percent body fat or percent lean body mass. Delayed intent-to-treat control crossover participants also increased PA (+1337 steps/day; p=0.04). Eight months following completion of ALED-I (N=19), PA levels relapsed (-1555±399 steps/day; p=0.03) and were similar to levels before the intervention (6564±455 steps/day vs. 6459±399 steps/day; p=0.86). Interestingly, despite the relapse in PA, total cholesterol and triglycerides improved, -9.9% and -18.2%, respectively. There was no change in the control group for any inflammatory, oxidative stress or antioxidant biomarkers, however TNF-α decreased ( p=0.01) and CAT increased ( p=0.02) with corresponding inhibition of MPO in the ALED-I intervention group. The overall evidence from these three studies suggest that: (1) the ALED-I program increases objectively measured (pedometer) daily PA as effectively as the previously validated classroom-delivery format and traditional individualized exercise prescription; (2) the ALED-I program increases PA and improves some cardiometabolic disease risk factors such as triglycerides and central adiposity in middle-aged, sedentary, overweight, rural adults; (3) the ALED-I behavior modification program does not promote or facilitate long-term adherence of improved PA in this middle-aged, sedentary, and overweight adult population and is most effective at increasing short-term PA in those who are most sedentary; and (4) the ALED-I program produced some improvements in systemic levels of inflammation and antioxidant enzyme capacity likely due to the increased PA and/or reduced central adiposity.

Because children with low vision are at risk for social isolation and misperceptions by others about their abilities, the current study sought to understand the impact of participation in play therapy on self-confidence and self-efficacy in children with low vision. The current study used qualitative methods including participant observation, narrative, and expert check-in/supervision to track the progress of three children, ages 4, 6, and 9 years, with low vision. Each child participated in six sessions of child-centered play therapy in their school settings. A mobile play therapy room supplied with toys appropriate for children with visual impairment was created and established for each session in the schools. Transcripts (videotape and audiotape) of each session were analyzed for themes, and cross-case analyses were conducted. Classroom teachers and visual impairment teachers were consulted weekly regarding their observations on behavior change during the course of therapy. In addition, classroom teachers and visual impairment teachers were asked to complete a survey to assess their perception of the child's self-efficacy before therapy and after therapy. The findings suggest that children with low vision may benefit from play therapy as evidenced by their progress in therapy and teacher reports. The findings also suggest that children with low vision seem to be capable of engaging in a wide variety of play behaviors including exploratory, functional/manipulative, make-believe, and games with rules. Further, the findings remind us that the development of children with disabilities are also influenced by many of the same factors as children without disability, that is, age, gender, family characteristics, and socioeconomic status. Implications and suggestions for future research are provided.

For the period of 2001-2005, generalized reporting for three newspapers, the Los Angeles Times from Los Angeles, CA, the Miami Herald from Miami, FL, and the Denver Post from Denver, CO, included over four thousand articles and covered 21 primary topics and over 200 secondary topics. Eight trends emerge from the content analysis. Trend 1, from the ivory tower to the public domain, identifies increasingly critical public scrutiny of higher education standards and curricula. Fight or flight, Trend 2, reveals more consistent no-tolerance policies for student behavior. Trend 3, scholar to celebrity, reveals an increasingly public role for university presidents. Academic freedom to academic flexibility, Trend 4, identifies a tightening of academic freedom policies for university staff and faculty. Trend 5, pay now, learn later, focuses on increased popularity of pre-paid and tax free plans for saving college tuition. Fraternity party to fraternity accountability, Trend 6, identifies increased scrutiny of Greek organizations and Greek life within the university environment. Trend 7, tenure to temporary, reflects the growing trend of hiring more part-time faculty rather than hiring faculty for tenure track positions or full-time instructor jobs. Lastly, campus to cyberspace, Trend 8, identifies the continued success of online instruction at the university level.

Periodically reviewing the methods researchers use to retain participants throughout the follow-up period is important. We review the effectiveness of methods to maximize completion rates in a 1-year longitudinal study of repeat driving-under-the-influence (DUI) offenders. Method: During the course of 21 months, we attempted to follow-up with 704 participants of a licensed residential treatment facility for repeat DUI offenders. High rates of lifetime Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, substance-use disorders (97.6%) and nonsubstance- or nongambling-related psychiatric disorders (44.5%) among the sample made tracking participants difficult. To locate participants and complete follow-up interviews, we obtained baseline information, contacted collaterals, sent mailed reminders, searched Internet databases, and gave a monetary incentive for completing study interviews. Results: We located 608 participants with active telephone numbers (87.4%) and completed interviews with 488 (70.1% of the entire eligible sample and 80.3% of those with active telephone numbers), after an average (SD) of 8.6 (9.1) calls (median = 5.0). Increasing the number of calls continued to yield additional completions at 10,20, and 30 calls; at approximately 40 telephone calls, the potential return for additional calls did not justify the added effort. Conclusions: These results suggest that researchers need to (1) employ more than 10 telephone calls to adequately track difficult-to-follow substance-using populations, and (2) prepare for a subsample of participants who might require more extensive contact. These results highlight the importance of using empirical guidelines to plan estimates for the number of contacts needed to achieve an adequate follow-up completion rate.

The research focused on how teachers’ attitudes and beliefs evolved over about 6–7 months of implementing the pocket PCs in their teaching. The findings indicated that the effect of pocket PCs on the attitudes of primary teachers were mixed while that on the secondary teachers was uncertainty. However, both primary and secondary teachers shared similar beliefs in the motivational aspect of the technology on student engagement and its capacity to cater for weaker students, particularly in English, but not for the more academic students. Issues such as leadership roles, the time-consuming nature of lesson preparation, the need to integrate higher-order thinking tasks with pocket PC usage and personal ownership for successful integration of the technology are discussed.

The following four papers all explore the challenge of learner engagement from a variety of different angles: instructional design, student support and the pedagogy of innovative, technology-mediated learning environments. Russell recognizes first that technology adoption lies with the lecturer and second that lecturers do not act alone. The paper by Cebeci et al. is the first of three papers that look for relationships between learner engagement and success. Malcolm Rutter examines the informal use of synchronous chat in computer laboratories and looks for relationships between self-reported use of chat and assessment marks. Maltby and Mackie take a different approach to measuring engagement. In their study they track learner engagement through the use of the institutional virtual learning environment (VLE). Finally, Matthew D. Riddle examines learner engagement through online role play. Starting with the constructivist notion that learners will be more fully engaged through practice in authentic learning environments, Riddle evaluates how students become engaged with online identities in a simulated professional environment.

The general issue inherent in and guiding the questions asked (as well as the analyses conducted) is whether IT functions to displace or expand various daily activities. In general, Internet use was not correlated with lower use of other personal communications or mass communications media—nor with lower levels of other social activities like church attendance or arts participation. In many cases the Internet was associated with increased use of other media or activities.

The proposed controller not only possesses some degree of robustness against the system model uncertainties, but also tracks the target without its 3D velocity information. The visual state estimator aims to estimate the optimal system state and target image velocity, which is used by the visual tracking controller. To achieve this, a self-tuning Kalman filter is proposed to estimate interesting parameters and to overcome the temporary occlusion problem. Furthermore, because the proposed method is fully working in the image space, the computational complexity and the sensor/camera modeling errors can be reduced. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, in terms of tracking performance, system convergence, and robustness.

However, little is known about participant characteristics, social relationships in SNSs, and the reasons for usage. In addition, the effects of SNS participation on people with depression are rather unknown. Objective: The aim was to explore the potential benefits and harms of an SNS for depression based on a concurrent triangulation design of mixed methods strategy, including qualitative content analysis and social network analysis. Methods: A cross-sectional Internet survey of participants, which involved the collection of SNS log files and a questionnaire, was conducted in an SNS for people with self-reported depressive tendencies in Japan in 2007. Quantitative data, which included user demographics, depressive state, and assessment of the SNS (positive vs not positive), were statistically analyzed. Descriptive contents of responses to open-ended questions concerning advantages and disadvantages of SNS participation were analyzed using the inductive approach of qualitative content analysis. Contents were organized into codes, concepts, categories, and a storyline based on the grounded theory approach. Social relationships, derived from data of “friends,” were analyzed using social network analysis, in which network measures and the extent of interpersonal association were calculated based on the social network theory. Each analysis and integration of results were performed through a concurrent triangulation design of mixed methods strategy. Results: There were 105 participants. Median age was 36 years, and 51% (36/71) were male. There were 37 valid respondents; their number of friends and frequency of accessing the SNS were significantly higher than for invalid/nonrespondents ( P = .008 and P = .003). Among respondents, 90% (28/31) were mildly, moderately, or severely depressed. Assessment of the SNS was performed by determining the access frequency of the SNS and the number of friends. Qualitative content analysis indicated that user-selectable peer support could be passive, active, and/or interactive based on anonymity or ease of use, and there was the potential harm of a downward depressive spiral triggered by aggravated psychological burden. Social network analysis revealed that users communicated one-on-one with each other or in small groups (five people or less). A downward depressive spiral was related to friends who were moderately or severely depressed and friends with negative assessment of the SNS. Conclusions: An SNS for people with depressive tendencies provides various opportunities to obtain support that meets users’ needs. To avoid a downward depressive spiral, we recommend that participants do not use SNSs when they feel that the SNS is not user-selectable, when they get egocentric comments, when friends have a negative assessment of the SNS, or when they have additional psychological burden.

Logistic models were created by using survey data collected by the Food and Drug Administration in 1999 and 2002. Results show that throughout the years, health-care providers remain the most used and strongest means associated with patients' direct requests for nonspecific and specific prescription drugs from doctors. The small-print information source gains power and changes from an indirect means associated with patients' discussing drugs with health-care providers to a direct means associated with patients' asking about nonspecific and specific drugs from their doctors. The Internet is not directly related to drug requests, but the effect of its association with patients seeking information from health-care providers grew 11-fold over the course of the study. The toll-free number lost its power altogether for both direct request for a prescription drug and further discussion with health-care providers. Patient demographics will be considered for specific policy implications.

The Internet has the potential to provide large populations with individual advice at relatively low cost. Objective: The focus of the study was the Web-based tailored physical activity intervention Active-online. The main research questions were (1) How effective is Active-online, compared to a non tailored website, in increasing self-reported and objectively measured physical activity levels in the general population when delivered in a real-life setting? (2) Do respondents recruited for the randomized study differ from spontaneous users of Active-online, and how does effectiveness differ between these groups? (3) What is the impact of frequency and duration of use of Active-online on changes in physical activity behavior? Methods: Volunteers recruited via different media channels completed a Web-based baseline survey and were randomized to Active-online (intervention group) or a non tailored website (control group). In addition, spontaneous users were recruited directly from the Active-online website. In a subgroup of participants, physical activity was measured objectively using accelerometers. Follow-up assessments took place 6 weeks (FU1), 6 months (FU2), and 13 months (FU3) after baseline. Results: A total of 1531 respondents completed the baseline questionnaire (intervention group n = 681, control group n = 688, spontaneous users n = 162); 133 individuals had valid accelerometer data at baseline. Mean age of the total sample was 43.7 years, and 1146 (74.9%) were women. Mixed linear models (adjusted for sex, age, BMI category, and stage of change) showed a significant increase in self-reported mean minutes spent in moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity from baseline to FU1 (coefficient = 0.14, P = .001) and to FU3 (coefficient = 0.19, P < .001) in all participants with no significant differences between groups. A significant increase in the proportion of individuals meeting the HEPA recommendations (self-reported) was observed in all participants between baseline and FU3 (OR = 1.47, P = .03), with a higher increase in spontaneous users compared to the randomized groups (interaction between FU3 and spontaneous users, OR = 2.95, P = .02). There were no increases in physical activity over time in any group for objectively measured physical activity. A significant relation was found between time spent on the tailored intervention and changes in self-reported physical activity between baseline and FU3 (coefficient = 1.13, P = .03, intervention group and spontaneous users combined). However, this association was no longer significant when adjusting for stage of change. Conclusions: In a real-life setting, Active-online was not more effective than a non tailored website in increasing physical activity levels in volunteers from the general population. Further research may investigate ways of integrating Web-based physical activity interventions in a wider context, for example, primary care or workplace health promotion.

The paper uses a qualitative analysis of web-based versions of the eight most popular newspapers in Viet Nam to track reporting over four phases of the implementation of the legislation, identifying codes and constructing the dominant themes of the media coverage. The study documents the justification and promotion of the legislation, and the mechanisms for preparing for its implementation at a national and local level, developing solutions and encouraging the replication of successful strategies. It records opposition and obstacles to helmet use, and concerns raised around the quality of helmets purchased. In return, the press notes the response of the market in innovative solutions to these problems. With the successful implementation of the legislation, the functions of the print media in promulgating and promoting the legislation, together with the reporting of ongoing resistance to the process, serve to enable a dialogue between the State and population around expressed concerns. In highlighting quality control of helmets as a key issue, the media have identified a potential ongoing role in monitoring the state's initiative in reducing the road toll from traumatic brain injury in motorcyclists.

The effectiveness of these materials depends largely on their content being disseminated to educators and to those in the clinical setting. Objective: To identify the concussion management methods and guidelines currently taught in the athletic training classroom and clinical settings and to track the dissemination of the Vienna guidelines throughout the educational curriculum. Design: A 17-question Internet survey. Setting: A Web link was e-mailed to the program directors and certified athletic trainers holding educational positions in athletic training at 300 accredited programs in the United States. Patients or Other Participants: 513 program directors and athletic trainers. Main Outcome Measure(s): Survey questions addressed education level, years of certification, employment setting, concussion assessment and return-to-play guidelines used in the clinical setting and the classroom, and clinical and teaching preferences for existing position statements and concussion grading systems. The Vienna guidelines' “simple” and “complex” definitions of concussions were provided with the return-to-play stepwise approach. Results: The National Athletic Trainers' Association position statement was the most widely used method of assessing, managing (61%), and making return-to-play decisions (47%) among participants. More than half of participants (66%) had never heard of the Vienna guidelines. After reading the Vienna guidelines' definitions and return-to-play criteria, nearly three-fourths of participants agreed with them. In addition, 68% said that they would use them, and 84% reported that they would teach them to students.

Results: Uptake was sufficient, but dropout was high. Many usage indices were positively associated with short-term depressive improvement, whereas only homework was related to long-term improvement. Acceptability was good and expectancy could predict long-term, but not short-term outcome. Limitations: Associations between use of CCBT and improvement are merely correlational.

This is crucial because lifestyle habits are formed at an early age and track in later life. This study is the first to examine EBRB clustering in children as young as 2 years. Study design: Cross-sectional data originated from the Child, Parent and Health: Lifestyle and Genetic Constitution (KOALA) Birth Cohort Study. Parents of 2578 2-year-old children completed a questionnaire. Correlation analyses, principal component analyses, and linear regression analyses were performed to examine clustering of EBRBs. Results: We found modest but consistent correlations in EBRBs. Two clusters emerged: a “sedentary-snacking cluster” and a “fiber cluster.” Television viewing clustered with computer use and unhealthy dietary behaviors. Children who frequently consumed vegetables also consumed fruit and brown bread more often and white bread less often. Lower maternal education and maternal obesity were associated with high scores on the sedentary-snacking cluster, whereas higher educational level was associated with high fiber cluster scores. Conclusions: Obesity-prone behavioral clusters are already visible in 2-year-old children and are related to maternal characteristics. The findings suggest that obesity prevention should apply an integrated approach to physical activity and dietary intake in early childhood.

In this study, we explored the uses and perceived benefits of using a LMS to support traditional classroom teaching as reported by instructors and students at a large American Midwestern university. We examined two years of survey data focusing on specific uses of the LMS that emphasized either efficient communication or interactive teaching and learning practices. We matched aggregate user log data with corresponding survey items to see if system use was consistent with patterns seen in the survey results. Findings suggest that instructors and students value tools and activities for efficient communication more than interactive tools for innovating existing practices. However, survey item analysis reveals that instructors and students also highly value the teaching and learning tools within the LMS.

School-based health centers (SBHCs) provide a wide range of health services, but little is known about immunization delivery in SBHCs. The objective of this investigation was to assess, in a national random sample of SBHCs, adolescent immunization practices and perceived barriers to vaccination.  Methods: One thousand SBHCs were randomly selected from a national database. Surveys were conducted between November 2007 and March 2008 by Internet and standard mail. Results: Of 815 survey-eligible SBHCs, 521 (64%) responded. Of the SBHCs, 84% reported vaccinating adolescents, with most offering tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis, meningococcal conjugate, and human papillomavirus vaccines. Among SBHCs that vaccinated adolescents, 96% vaccinated Medicaid-insured and 98% vaccinated uninsured students. Although 93% of vaccinating SBHCs participated in the Vaccines for Children program, only 39% billed private insurance for vaccines given. A total of 69% used an electronic database or registry to track vaccines given, and 83% sent reminders to adolescents and/or their parents if immunizations were needed. For SBHCs that did not offer vaccines, difficulty billing private insurance was the most frequently cited barrier to vaccination. Conclusions: Most SBHCs appear to be fully involved in immunization delivery to adolescents, offering newly recommended vaccines and performing interventions such as reminder/recall to improve immunization rates. Although the number of SBHCs is relatively small, with roughly 2000 nationally, SBHCs appear to be an important vaccination resource, particularly for low income and uninsured adolescents who may have more limited access to vaccination elsewhere.

In total, 65 overweight/obese male staff and students at the University of Newcastle (mean (s.d.) age = 35.9 (11.1) years; BMI = 30.6 (2.8)) were randomly assigned to either (i) Internet group ( n = 34) or (ii) control group (information only) ( n = 31). Both groups received one face-to-face information session and a program booklet. Internet group participants used the study website to self-monitor diet and activity with feedback provided based on participants' online entries on seven occasions over 3 months. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3-, and 6-month follow-up for weight, waist circumference, BMI, blood pressure, resting heart rate, objectively measured physical activity, and self-reported total daily kilojoules. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significant weight loss of 5.3 kg (95% confidence interval (CI): -7.3, -3.3) at 6 months for the Internet group and 3.5 kg (95% CI: -5.5, -1.4) for the control group. A significant time effect was found for all outcomes but no between-group differences. Per-protocol analysis revealed a significant group-by-time interaction ( P < 0.001), with compliers losing more weight at 6 months (-9.1 kg; 95% CI -11.8, -6.5) than noncompliers (-2.7 kg; 95% CI -5.3, -0.01) and the control group (-4.2 kg; 95% CI -6.2, -2.2). Simple weight-loss interventions can be effective in achieving statistically and clinically significant weight loss in men. The Internet is a feasible and effective medium for weight loss in men but strategies need to be explored to improve engagement in online programs.

The impact of PBL depends on the tutors’ quality and the students’ motivation. To enhance students’ motivation and satisfaction and to overcome the problems with the changing quality of tutors, online learning and face-to-face classes were systematically combined resulting in a blended learning scenario (blended problem-based learning—bPBL). The study aims at determining whether bPBL increases the students’ motivation and supports the learning process with respect to the students’ cooperation, their orientation, and more reliable tutoring. The blended PBL was developed in a cooperation of students and teachers. The well-established Seven Jump-scheme of PBL was carefully complemented by eLearning modules. On the first training day of bPBL the students start to work together with the online program, but without a tutor, on the final training day the tutor participates in the meeting for additional help and feedback. The program was evaluated by a mixed-method study. The traditional PBL course was compared with the blended PBL by means of qualitative and quantitative questionnaires, standardized group interviews, and students’ test results. In addition log-files were analyzed. A total of 185 third-year students and 14 tutors took part in the study. Motivation, subjective learning gains and satisfaction achieved significantly higher ratings by the bPBL students compared with the students learning by traditional PBL. The tutors’ opinion and the test results showed no differences between the groups. Working with the web-based learning environment was assessed as very good by the students. According to the log-file analysis, the web-based learning module was frequently used and improved the cooperation during the self-directed learning.

Methods: The Youth Internet Safety Survey-2 was a national, RDD telephone survey conducted in March–June 2005. Eight hundred households (one caregiver and one child between the ages of 10 and 17 years) with home Internet access answered questions pertaining to Internet prevention activities in the household and adolescent behaviors and exposures online. Results: Unwanted exposure to sexual material occurred in 32% of youth in homes with pop-up/spam blockers and 25% of youth in homes with filtering, blocking, or monitoring software on the home computer, compared to 43% of households without preventive software installed on the home computer. Among otherwise similar youth, pop-up/spam blockers installed on the home computer were significantly associated with 59% lower odds of reporting unwanted exposure to sexual material on the home computer; and filtering, blocking, or monitoring software was significantly associated with 65% lower odds. When data were stratified by youth sex, associations between preventive software and unwanted exposure were similar for boys and girls. When stratified by age, preventive software was associated with significantly reduced risk of unwanted exposure for 10–12-year olds and 13–15-year olds, but not for 16–17-year olds. Conclusion: Although these correlational analyses are far from providing conclusive evidence that preventive software protects children from unwanted exposure to sexual material online, findings suggest that caregivers of boys and girls 15 years of age and younger who want to reduce the likelihood of unwanted exposure to sexual material on the home computer should consider including preventive software—especially filtering, blocking, or monitoring software—in their Internet safety plan. Practice implications: Practitioners should partner with caregivers in developing an Internet safety plan, including proactive caregiver-youth discussions about expected Internet behavior appropriate for their household.

Recently, the researches on the multilinear algebra provide the possibility to hold the spatial structural relationship in a representation of the image ensembles. In this paper, a third-order color tensor is constructed to represent the object to be tracked. Considering the influence of the environment changing on the tracking, the biased discriminant analysis (BDA) is extended to the tensor biased discriminant analysis (TBDA) for distinguishing the object from the background. At the same time, an incremental scheme for the TBDA is developed for the tensor biased discriminant subspace online learning, which can be used to adapt to the appearance variant of both the object and background. The experimental results show that the proposed method can track objects precisely undergoing large pose, scale and lighting changes, as well as partial occlusion.

Studies conducted online are not only less error prone and labor intensive but also rapidly reach large numbers of diverse participants at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods. In addition to improving the efficiency and accuracy of data collection, online studies provide automatic data storage and deliver immediate personalized feedback to research participants—a major incentive that can exponentially expand participant pools. Furthermore, behavioral researchers can also track data on online behavioral phenomena, including Instant Messaging (IM), social networking, and other social media. This book goes beyond the basics to teach readers advanced methods for conducting behavioral research on the Internet. Short chapters offer practical advice by leading experts in key domains of Internet research. Readers are shown, step by step, how to conduct online experiments, surveys, and ability testing, use advanced graphic tools such as drag-and-drop objects, apply automatic text analysis tools, check the validity of protocols, automate the storage and analysis of data, record ""field notes"" on the behavior of online subjects and chatroom or blogging communities, and much more. Chapters also address critical issues such as data security, ethics, participant recruitment, and how to ensure the completion of tests or questionnaires. This volume also features a companion Web site with additional resources, links, scripts, and instructions to further assist readers with their online research.

T.","Madmen: An evolutionary perspective on anger and men's violent responses to transgression","International handbook of anger: Constituent and concomitant biological, psychological, and social processes","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/622149336?accountid=14026","Though often described as leading to costly and irrational decisions, anger's effects on behavior are understandable when anger is viewed as an adaptation favored by natural selection. Anger motivates responses to transgression despite our propensity to discount the future, truncating ongoing transgressions and deterring additional transgressions. An evolutionary perspective sheds light on differences in anger's effects on male and female behavior. Due to differences in the variance of reproductive success between men and women, men can be viewed as playing a higher stakes game than women, one in which the fitness consequences of transgression are generally greater. Selection has therefore favored more risky aggressive responses to transgressions in men, with corresponding differences in the propensity to engage in other forms of risky behavior. This explains both robust sex differences in rates of violence and parallel patterns in other forms of risk taking. Similarly, the cost/benefit ratio of aggression and other forms of risk taking changes both across the lifecycle and as a function of reproductive status; involvement in violence and other risky behavior directly tracks such changes. Matching the physical architecture to the tasks at hand, changes in both male musculature and underlying neurophysiology likewise correspond to changes in the payoffs of aggressive responses to transgression.

First, where and how do foundations get involved in urban education politics? Certain districts receive the bulk of foundation grants while other, similarly troubled districts, receive none. I track foundation grants to the 100 largest school districts and show how political characteristics and the district's capacity for nonprofit and policy expertise guide where grants go. Second, what are the political consequences of foundation involvement? I focus on two cases of large scale foundation involvement in urban education—New York City and Los Angeles. Using an original data set of more than 3,000 foundation grants, I find that the share of grants to the public sector (school districts and states) shrank from 2000 to 2005, and the share of grants to charter schools, private schools, and venture philanthropy for education nonprofit start-ups grew substantially. Using multivariate models, I find that districts with mayoral or state control, rather than an elected school board, receive more grant dollars, as do districts with greater capacity for nonprofit expertise; these characteristics are stronger predictors of grants to a district than graduation rate or the share of students in poverty. In New York, foundations have adopted a top-down funding strategy focused on the district bureaucracy and nonprofits. In Los Angeles, the funding strategy is bottom-up, with grant dollars supporting alternatives to the district such as charter schools. I use social network analysis to present a funding network of foundations and their grantees, and I create networks of policy information exchange based on survey results. My findings in New York show that a coalition of policy experts—foundations, the school district bureaucracy, and education nonprofits—is setting the agenda for education reform. Parents, community organizations, and unions are largely excluded from this coalition. Although Los Angeles seems to lack centralized leadership for reform, there is a core set of diverse actors that are closely linked by sharing policy information. The core includes major foundations, charter management organizations, advocacy organizations, and district leaders.

"RM9CW738","thesis","2010","McDowall, Sharleen","Gender differences in gambling-related beliefs: The role of types of gambling","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/622198353?accountid=14026","Historically, gambling has been considered a male activity. However, in recent years, the increase and accessibility of gambling venues has led to an increase in female gamblers. To date, the “feminization” of gambling has not been reflected in the gambling literature therefore this study's aim was to contribute to this area of research in order to gain a deeper understanding of the experience of the female problem gambler. The purpose of this study was to explore whether there are gender differences in gambling-related beliefs among types gambling. Archival data collected at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health was used for this study. In the original study, a sample of two hundred and forty (240) subjects who were experiencing gambling problems was recruited from the Greater Toronto Area. Subjects were administered a battery of psychometric tests including the Gambler's Belief Questionnaire (GBQ), Gambling Attitudes and Belief Survey (GABS), Gambling Cognition Questionnaire (GCQ), Magical Ideation Scale (MIS), Irrational Belief Scale (IBS), and Belief in Personal Control Scale (BPCS) and a brief demographic questionnaire. Three approaches to classifying gambling types were evaluated: (a) six gambling types (bingo, lotteries, cards, track, sports, and slot machines, (b) perception of skill (skilled versus non-skill games), (c) perceived randomness (non-random, random, casino). The results revealed that there were some unique gender differences in gambling-related beliefs among individuals who have problems with gambling. More specifically, the outcome of this study revealed that female problem gamblers expressed higher scores on the IBS indicating a tendency to express dysfunctional beliefs about oneself, others, relationships, and the world, for all gambling activities except for lotteries. For the lottery problem gamblers, men showed higher IBS scores. For perception of skill, results showed little difference between genders for the non-skill games on the IBS. However, the skilled female problems gamblers had much higher IBS scores than did skilled males problem gamblers suggesting that this sub-sample of female problem gamblers tended to have more extreme dysfunctional beliefs about the self, others and relationships. Similarly, women who reported difficulty with skill games had higher scores on the GABS than did men. A reverse pattern was observed on the non-skill games with the men who reported difficulty with these games showing higher scores on the GABS. Results from the perceived randomness classification revealed little difference between genders for casino games (i.e., slot machines, card games) on the IBS. However, for the non-random (i.e. sports, track) and random games (i.e. bingo, lotteries), the female non-random gamblers had much higher IBS scores than did men non-random gamblers. These results suggest that female non-random gamblers have more extreme dysfunctional beliefs about the self, others and relationships when compare to male non-random gamblers. Similarly, the male gamblers who preferred random games tended to have higher IBS scores than the females who preferred random games. On the GABS, results showed that female non-random gamblers tended to score more severe than did the male non-random gamblers therefore suggesting that female non-random gamblers believe gambling to be exciting, socially meaningful and strategies (even illusory one), as well as luck, are important. Likewise, the male random gamblers tended to score more severe on the GABS than did the female non-random gamblers. Lastly, females non-random gamblers tended to endorse stronger beliefs regarding illusion of control and luck than did male-random gamblers.

The study adapted a mixed methodology that combined a quantitative descriptive questionnaire and phenomenological qualitative interviews through the use of semistructured questions. The questionnaire consisted of 27 questions to compare perceived self-proficiency to motivation and intention to continue. A second goal of the questionnaire compared perceived quality of instruction to motivation and intention to continue in the programs. Results from the questionnaire indicated that the students' level of proficiency in use of the computer software and hardware is not a critical factor in online programs. Another finding was that art students feel that if they are receiving quality instruction, they are more likely to continue in their programs. The results from the 10 interviews identified the most important major themes: (a) the ability to work independently helps online art students to feel more successful, (b) the ability to assimilate new technology quickly encourages online art students to feel more successful, (c) the ability to consistently improve their drawing skills through practice allows online art students to become more successful, (d) the desire to improve one's life motivates online art students to continue in their online art programs, (e) the desire to improve their career motivated online art students to continue, and (f) the ability to work at home and at one's own convenience was a motivation to enroll in an online program. Among the recommendations are the following: (a) online art students should take the initiative to learn the required software quickly and effectively without much assistance; (b) online art students should develop self-sufficiency in their online art courses by asking frequent questions; (c) online art instructors should strive to provide frequent and substantial feedback to students; (d) instructors could also prepare themselves better in the use of the required course software; (e) online art schools should consider 24-hour technical support; and (f) online art schools should consider offering multiple tracks to better accommodate the needs of a wider range of students' schedules.

Niemiec (see record 2009-25270-000). Portrayals of mental illnesses and psychiatric therapies in the media, and especially in films, generate a lot of curiosity in the general public, and for medical practitioners it can be useful, and sometimes even necessary, to keep track of these works in order to understand the at times irrational fears or expectations of patients and their relatives. Popular films may present stereotypes or misinformation and generate false impressions. At the same time, they can inspire hope and motivation for change and provide contexts for therapeutic communication and encounters. This book reports about applying movies as teaching aids for medical students, psychiatric residents, and others students—a new aspect in the complex relationship between psychiatry and movies. There are successful, and thus widely popular, films that deal with specific aspects of illness and therapy. The authors of this book recommend outstanding films that can be discussed as case studies, illustrating psychopathological behavior. The 15 chapters introduce the main entities of the DSM, some crucial issues of disturbed mental states, and their possible ways of treatment. The reviewer recommends this volume not just to teachers of psychiatry and psychology, but also to lay people who might be concerned and interested in the issues involved.

"F5APBWCR","thesis","2010","Graves, Jennifer Anne","Essays in labor and public economics","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/754057824?accountid=14026","The present dissertation is comprised of three chapters. In chapter 1, I find that use of multi-track year-round school calendars results in a drop in national rank on standardized test scores. This finding has policy implications for school overcrowding, since multi-track year-round school calendars allow for schools to house more students within the same facility than other calendars and are often motivated by their potential to alleviate school overcrowding. In chapter 2, I estimate the effect of the E-rate program, which provided federally-funded discounts to libraries, on internet investment in libraries. Overall, results find potentially large impacts of the E-rate program discounts on internet investment in libraries receiving the highest discounts and small or no effects in libraries at other discount levels. Finally the third paper of the dissertation estimates the effect of care provision methods to elderly parents on the adult daughter's hours worked in the labor market. In this chapter, I present a time allocation model and discuss various modifications to the model, which I then use as a framework for motivation of different sets of instrumental variables. Instrumental variables results are primarily insignificant. For the sample of women with a high school degree or less, however, instrumental variables results show that informal caregiving at the time a parent becomes dependent reduces hours worked in the labor market and having a parent in a nursing home increase hours worked in the labor market.

As technology continues to change at a rapid pace, e-learning has become an important priority of corporate education. E-learning is evolving as a way to train and enhance employee value by combining different learning styles and varying delivery systems to create the best learning experience possible. One specific discipline of interest to this study is the growth of e-learning in healthcare education. Much like other sectors of the economy, the amount of online instruction for healthcare professionals has increased dramatically, but research examining the effectiveness has lagged behind. This study was conducted in response to the need for research in the effectiveness of e-learning in healthcare training and the transfer of knowledge to the workplace. This case study examined how e-learning was developed, implemented, and evaluated in three different healthcare-related companies. The final goal was to identify how corporations determine the effectiveness of their programs and the transfer of knowledge to the job. This study followed a qualitative research design and more specifically, it was designed as a collective case study (Stake, 1995). The results of the study indicate that in order to improve individual and organizational performance, evaluation and measurement must be essential components of the training process. There is a need for the development of uniform measurements to track the connections between learning, employee performance, and profitability. The data from this study can be used to help guide companies and organizations in the development of future e-learning initiatives and standards. The study also illuminates the need for a comprehensive e-learning evaluation model.

"N6DVJKK8","thesis","2010","Jones, Michael D.","Heroes and villains: Cultural narratives, mass opinions, and climate change","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/822366870?accountid=14026","Global climate change is easily identified as one of the most pressing and contentious policy problems facing not only the United States, but the human race. In a democratic society such as our own, understanding the public's capacities and tendencies in processing information and forming opinions about climate change has serious and far-reaching policy implications. Historically quite low, public knowledge about climate change is now on the rise, as is the importance of the issue on the public agenda (Leiserowitz, 2005). Consequently, it is not unreasonable to expect the public, for better or worse, to play a larger role in future climate policy melees. In light of the prospect of an increasingly important public role in shaping policy contours, this dissertation seeks to test how and why individuals form opinions and assessments of risk about climate change. In order to address these questions, two theories that account for both individual internal factors and external stimuli in opinion formation and change are merged to create a Cultural Narrative Model (CNM). The first, Cultural Theory (CT), argues that there are four exclusive value orientations to which individuals subscribe based upon preferred levels of group interaction and the degree that these groups are expected to constrain the individual's beliefs and behavior. These value orientations are always present and influence how incoming information is processed (Wildavsky, 1987; Thompson et al., 1990). CT has a proven history of explaining variation in opinion and risk perceptions (Wildavsky & Dake, 1990); however, the influence of message structures in CT scholarship is lacking. This research operationalizes narrative theory to address this gap. Seeking to determine if cultural narratives help explain variations in climate change opinion related dependent variables, two research questions are addressed:  RQ1: Narrative Structure: Does narrative structure influence opinions related to climate change? RQ2: Cultural Narrative Content: Does cultural narrative content explain variation in opinions related to climate change? Specific hypotheses derived from the above research questions are tested using an online internet survey with a built in experimental design. Four experimental tracks are employed, including a control list and three cultural narrative treatments. Several statistical tools, including analysis of variance and OLS regression analysis are used to assess each hypothesis. The survey sample consists of roughly fifteen-hundred nationally representative respondents surveyed from within the United States. Findings indicate that while cultural content does not appear to influence opinions about climate change, narrative structure plays a powerful role in shaping opinion. Specifically, findings show that the vehicle through which narrative structure persuades is the hero character. Examining eleven climate change opinion related variables, as positive affect for the hero increases so too do respondent preferences and beliefs in direction specified by the cultural narrative treatments.

The population for this study was faculty members at Tennessee State University and at the University of Memphis, who instructed face-to-face, hybrid/blended, and fully online classes using D2L during the fall semester of 2009. Study participants completed an online research electronic data capture survey answering questions on 18 Likert-scale items of 1 (never) to 5 (always). Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data. The principles were compared by subgroups using t-test for gender and graduate/undergraduate instructors. ANOVAs were used to compare mean score by employment (tenured, non-tenure-track, tenure-track), and by course type (undergraduate and graduate). There were 129 faculty members who completed the study questionnaire. Results suggested that faculty members incorporated all seven principles at varying levels. Gender, type of employment, or the level of classes taught did not make any difference in how respondents taught with D2L. Three categories were used to group the mean scores: high (3.51–5.0); medium (2.51–3.5); and low (2.5–1.0). Based on these scores, high expectation was ranked the highest with a score of 3.51. Principles with median scores were: student faculty contact, 3.08; diverse talents and ways of learning, 3.06; time on task, 2.89; active learning, 2.55; and cooperation among students, 2.38. Prompt feedback was ranked the lowest at 2.07. Recommendations of the study were: Online instructors at both Tennessee State University and the University of Memphis should encourage online collaboration among students, specifically when they teach with D2L. Faculty members should share ideas on the best practices of the meaningful use of discussion boards and video-conferencing tools when teaching with D2L. Ongoing support in leveraging collaboration tools should be provided to both institutions. This will empower D2L instructors to be more creative integrating collaboration tools into their teaching.

A total of 30 patients (mean age 14 years, mean BMI 32.7 kg/m²) were admitted to our hospital to participate in a structured treatment and teaching programme (STTP). To assess physical activity and eating habits, a mobile motion sensor board (MoSeBo) or a sensor for physical activity, integrated into a mobile phone with digital camera (DiaTrace) was used. Over an average period of four days of monitoring, the mean intensity (15.4 activity units) and duration of physical activity (267 min/d) were recorded with the mobile sensors. The mean time spent walking was 64 min/d, running 11 min/d, cycling 24 min/d and car driving 21 min/d. There were significant differences ( P < 0.001) between self-reported physical activity and objective assessment: in general the duration of physical activity documented by children and adolescents was much higher than the objective assessment. Similarly, the real caloric intake was higher than the self-estimates ( P = 0.085). A multivariate analysis showed that the following variables were significantly associated with weight reduction in the hospital STTP (R-squared = 0.59): high motivation, intrafamilial conflicts, duration of physical activity assessed with the MoSeBo/DiaTrace system, and the body fat mass at onset of therapy. All children and adolescents included in the trial completed it. Although the MoSeBo/DiaTrace system was used for a relatively short period in each patient, the high acceptance demonstrated that it could be integrated into therapy easily.

The purposes of the research reported here are to understand marketing students’ perceptions of the learning achieved from the use of simulation games, and marketing lecturers’ perceptions of the barriers to increased use of simulation games. Design/methodology/approach: A structured questionnaire was administered to 137 final-year marketing undergraduates studying at two British universities and eight semi-structured interviews were conducted with marketing lecturers currently using simulation games in their marketing teaching. Findings: Students perceive the simulation game to be a highly effective learning method, delivering valuable knowledge and skills. In addition, students find the game to be an enjoyable learning approach. Lecturers are enthusiastic about this learning method, but note some barriers to adoption; particularly cost, the steep learning curve, and the difficulty of finding unbiased advice about suitable games to deliver desired learning outcomes. Research limitations/implications: Limitations are that the empirical base for the quantitative study was only two universities in the UK, and the questionnaire concerned only student perceptions of their learning, not an objective assessment of actual learning. It is recommended that the study be extended to a wider sample of universities, and that the approach be widened to include an assessment of the measurable learning outcomes achieved rather than just student perceptions. Originality/value: The degree of student enthusiasm for simulation games is striking. Lecturers also find the method very engaging, but acknowledge that there are important barriers to more widespread simulation game adoption.

These studies include descriptive accounts, both qualitative and quantitative, of behavior-in-context in naturally-occurring and quasi-experimental settings, especially involving the micro-analysis of video. To unify this piecemeal but burgeoning literature, “cognition” is taken as embodied, largely visible, and distributed across physical and social environments. Its study involves documenting the adaptation of behavior to changing conditions, especially in ontogeny, tool-use, and social discourse. The studies selected for this review focus on the cognitive complexity that is apparent in the versatility, the hierarchical organization, and the long-term patterning of such behavioral adaptations. Versatility is seen, for example, in the substitution of different acts or objects into established routines, in the size and flexibility of action repertoires that enable variably configured and sequenced performances, and in the marked occurrence of individual differences. Hierarchical organization is seen in the substitution or iteration of a subroutine that fails to disrupt its larger routine, in the simultaneous embedding of one social interaction within the frame of another (as in “social tool” use), and in the insertion of a novel or borrowed subroutine as a tactical response, especially one that temporarily redirects an animal's trajectory. The complexity apparent in long-term patterning includes tracking and making selective use of multiple histories (e.g., concerning kinship, rank, etc.) whose predictions and tactics may vary, responding to “market” values that change with ecological and social factors, and exploiting traditions of practice which provide social and material resources that shape engagement and learning. While this literature includes far more primate than cetacean examples, the primate work offers helpful suggestions for settings, issues, and techniques that could be adapted to the sensori-motor, ecological, and social constraints on cetacean cognition. The array of observations reviewed illustrate the utility across species of scoring such parameters as displays of attention in multiple modalities, abrupt trajectory changes, the complementarity and contingency of actions, and the resiliency of sequences, to help identify the media that matter in a given cognitive ecology. Systematic micro-analyses, in conjunction with long-term relational data that track changes in affordances and coordination, make such observational approaches a viable and valuable addition to the study of comparative cognition.

We know what decision aids achieve in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but we still know very little about how they are used and how this relates to the informed decision making outcome measures. Objective: To examine men's use of an online decision aid for prostate cancer screening using website transaction log files (web-logs), and to examine associations between usage and components of informed decision making. Methods: We conducted an observational web-log analysis of users of an online decision aid, Prosdex. Men between 50 and 75 years of age were recruited for an associated RCT from 26 general practices across South Wales, United Kingdom. Men allocated to one arm of the RCT were included in the current study. Time and usage data were derived from website log files. Components of informed decision making were measured by an online questionnaire. Results: Available for analysis were 82 web-logs. Overall, there was large variation in the use of Prosdex. The mean total time spent on the site was 20 minutes. The mean number of pages accessed was 32 (SD 21) out of a possible 60 pages. Significant associations were found between increased usage and increased knowledge (Spearman rank correlation [ρ] = 0.69, P < .01), between increased usage and less favorable attitude towards PSA testing (ρ = -0.52, P < .01), and between increased usage and reduced intention to undergo PSA testing (ρ = -0.44, P < .01). A bimodal distribution identified two types of user: low access and high access users. Conclusions: Increased usage of Prosdex leads to more informed decision making, the key aim of the UK Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme. However, developers realistically have roughly 20 minutes to provide useful information that will support informed decision making when the patient uses a web-based interface. Future decision aids need to be developed with this limitation in mind. We recommend that web-log analysis should be an integral part of online decision aid development and analysis.

Their willingness to visit artificial feeders renders many species amenable to controlled experiments using mechanical “flowers” that replenish nectar automatically. However, the structural complexity of such feeders and the lack of a device for tracking the movements of multiple individuals have limited our ability to ask some specific questions related to natural foraging contexts, especially in competitive situations. To overcome such difficulties, we developed an experimental system for producing computer records of multiple foragers harvesting from simple artificial flowers with known rates of nectar secretion, using radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to identify individual animals. By using infrared detectors (light-emitting diodes and phototransistors) to activate the RFID readers momentarily when needed, our system prevents the RFID chips from heating up and disturbing the foraging behavior of focal animals. To demonstrate these advantages, we performed a preliminary experiment with a captive colony of bumble bees,  Bombus impatiens. In the experiment, two bees were tagged with RFID chips (2.5 × 2.5 mm, manufactured by Hitachi-Maxell, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and allowed to forage on 16 artificial flowers arranged in a big flight cage. Using the resulting data set, we present details of how the bees increased their travel speed between flowers, while decreasing the average nectar crop per flower, as they gained experience. Our system provides a powerful tool to track the movement patterns, reward history, and long-term foraging performance of individual foragers at large spatial scales.

Data included pretest survey scores of demographic, disease-related, and psychosocial factors and automatically collected ICCS use data over the 4-month intervention. Statistical analyses correlated pre-test survey scores with subsequent, specific types of ICCS service usage. Patterns of online cancer information seeking differed according to the patients' characteristics, suggesting that lower income, less educated women and those lacking in information-seeking competence use the computer and online services to the same or a greater degree if those services are made available to them.

The objective of this study was to measure diabetic veterans' access to and use of the Internet, and their interest in using MHV to help manage their diabetes. Materials and Methods: Cross-sectional mailed survey of 201 patients with type 2 diabetes and hemoglobin A 1c>8.0% receiving primary care at any of five primary care clinic sites affiliated with a VA tertiary care facility. Main measures included Internet usage, access, and attitudes; computer skills; interest in using the Internet; awareness of and attitudes toward MHV; demographics; and socioeconomic status. Results: A majority of respondents reported having access to the Internet at home. Nearly half of all respondents had searched online for information about diabetes, including some who did not have home Internet access. More than a third obtained “some” or “a lot” of their health-related information online. Forty-one percent reported being “very interested” in using MHV to help track their home blood glucose readings, a third of whom did not have home Internet access. Factors associated with being “very interested” were as follows: having access to the Internet at home ( p<0.001), “a lot/some” trust in the Internet as a source of health information ( p=0.002), lower age ( p=0.03), and some college ( p=0.04). Neither race ( p=0.44) nor income ( p=0.25) was significantly associated with interest in MHV. Conclusions: This study found that a diverse sample of older VA patients with sub-optimally controlled diabetes had a level of familiarity with and access to the Internet comparable to an age-matched national sample. In addition, there was a high degree of interest in using the Internet to help manage their diabetes.

Methods: Observational cohort study. Website log-files collected data on the use of BresDex. Online questionnaires assessed knowledge about breast cancer and treatment options, degree to which women were deliberating about their options, and surgery intentions, pre- and post-BresDex. Results: Readiness to make a decision significantly increased after using BresDex ( p < .001), although there was no significant improvement in knowledge. Participants that were ‘less ready’ to make a decision before using BresDex, spent a longer time using BresDex ( p < .05). Significant associations between surgery intentions and choices were observed ( p < .001), with the majority of participants going on to have BCS. Greater length of time spent on BresDex was associated with stronger intentions to have BCS ( p < .05). Conclusion: The use of BresDex appears to facilitate readiness to make a decision for surgery, helping to strengthen surgery intentions. Practice implications: BresDex may prove a useful adjunct to the support provided by the clinical team for women facing surgery for early breast cancer.

To this end, we track 3D objects modeled by line segments because the straight line feature is often used to model the environment. Indeed, we are interested in mobile robot navigation using omnidirectional vision in structured environments. In the case of omnidirectional vision, 3D straight lines are projected as conics in omnidirectional images. Under certain conditions, these conics may have singularities. In this paper, we present two contributions. We, first, propose a new spherical formulation of the pose estimation withdrawing singularities, using an object model composed of lines. The theoretical formulation and the validation on synthetic images thus show that the new formulation clearly outperforms the former image plane one. The second contribution is the extension of the spherical representation to the stereovision case. We consider in the paper a sensor which combines a camera and four mirrors. Results in various situations show the robustness to illumination changes and local mistracking. As a final result, the proposed new stereo spherical formulation allows us to localize online a robot indoor and outdoor whereas the classical formulation fails.

The book begins with a long introductory chapter where five fields are discussed: democracy, spatial planning, development, arts and museums, and communication. In the five remaining chapters Carpentier discusses the five 'structuring elements': power, identity, organization, technology and quality. Again he is highly systematic, treating them all first with a conceptual introduction and two case studies. Carpentier’s original theoretical position is his most valuable contribution to the field of new media research, but it is well hidden among the many literature reviews of this massive volume. His main theoretical tool is the continuum from minimalist to maximalist participation. The former is characterized by strong power imbalances between the actors, while the latter has a more egalitarian relationship between the actors. Carpentier uses the continuum to estimate and score various media broadcast formats. A more serious problem is the volume of paraphrases and quotes. Although Carpentier’s many literature reviews are lucid and relevant, they make me lose track of Carpentier’s own voice. He indulges in long quotes from authorities like Marx, Habermas and Foucault, and despite the fact that the quotes are extremely rich in implications, they are dealt with in only a few words, or they stand uncommented upon in the text. Carpentier simply hastens to the next position. This is problematic not just because of the resulting lack of readability, but also because it is often unclear whether Carpentier endorses the positions of these quotes, or merely shows their existence. The binding and typographic quality is low. The figures have low resolution, and some are almost too blurry to be read comfortably. Worst of all: there is no index, even though this book in particular would benefit from the possibility of making cross-references.

Over the last few years, the trend data produced by this service has shown a consistent relationship with the actual number of flu reports collected by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), often identifying increases in flu cases weeks in advance of CDC records. However, contrary to popular belief, Google Flu Trends is not an early epidemic detection system. Instead, it is designed as a baseline indicator of the trend, or changes, in the number of disease cases. Objective: To evaluate whether these trends can be used as a basis for an early warning system for epidemics. Methods: We present the first detailed algorithmic analysis of how Google Flu Trends can be used as a basis for building a fully automated system for early warning of epidemics in advance of methods used by the CDC. Based on our work, we present a novel early epidemic detection system, called FluBreaks (dritte.org/flubreaks), based on Google Flu Trends data. We compared the accuracy and practicality of three types of algorithms: normal distribution algorithms, Poisson distribution algorithms, and negative binomial distribution algorithms. We explored the relative merits of these methods, and related our findings to changes in Internet penetration and population size for the regions in Google Flu Trends providing data. Results: Across our performance metrics of percentage true-positives (RTP), percentage false-positives (RFP), percentage overlap (OT), and percentage early alarms (EA), Poisson- and negative binomial-based algorithms performed better in all except RFP. Poisson-based algorithms had average values of 99%, 28%, 71%, and 76% for RTP, RFP, OT, and EA, respectively, whereas negative binomial-based algorithms had average values of 97.8%, 17.8%, 60%, and 55% for RTP, RFP, OT, and EA, respectively. Moreover, the EA was also affected by the region’s population size. Regions with larger populations (regions 4 and 6) had higher values of EA than region 10 (which had the smallest population) for negative binomial- and Poisson-based algorithms. The difference was 12.5% and 13.5% on average in negative binomial- and Poisson-based algorithms, respectively. Conclusions: We present the first detailed comparative analysis of popular early epidemic detection algorithms on Google Flu Trends data. We note that realizing this opportunity requires moving beyond the cumulative sum and historical limits method-based normal distribution approaches, traditionally employed by the CDC, to negative binomial- and Poisson-based algorithms to deal with potentially noisy search query data from regions with varying population and Internet penetrations. Based on our work, we have developed FluBreaks, an early warning system for flu epidemics using Google Flu Trends.

An online survey was sent during 2010 September, the beginning of the academic year, to all 818 potential participants in the United States entry-level and doctoral programmes. Fifty six of 107 participants who met the criteria reported being in a mentoring relationship and positively rated their perception of the influence of mentoring on academic success and academic socialization. The response of all participants to open-ended questions describes preferred mentoring characteristics (providing information, support), benefits (having someone to go to, easing the stress) and challenges (not enough time, mentoring not valued). Findings inform current and potential faculty of the current state of mentoring.

Methods: An adventitious cohort of girls (n = 957) from the Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls were measured at sixth and eighth grade. Activities were identified using the 3-day physical activity recall and a self-report survey and used to create clusters of sixth-grade girls who had similar PA/sedentary behaviors. Accelerometry was used to assess PA in sixth and eighth grade. Data analysis consisted of FASTCLUS procedure and mixed model repeated measures analyses in SAS statistical software. Results: Cluster analysis yielded six clusters (C1: educational sedentary; C2: sports and play; C3: organized sports teams/classes/lessons in past year; C4: active transport and chores; C5: electronic media; C6: sleep). Sixth-grade girls in C2 and C3 had greater average daily minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), metabolic equivalent of a physical activity-weighted MVPA, and vigorous physical activity compared with other clusters ( p < .05). In eighth grade, sedentary time increased and PA declined among girls in all clusters ( p < .05). Girls in C2 had the greatest decline in PA, whereas girls' PA in C3 declined less. Conclusions: Encouraging participation in organized sports teams/class/lessons in middle school girls may promote greater MVPA and vigorous physical activity than other activities and may help to better sustain PA levels over time.

The basic premise behind this particular model is that ELL students should be taught the English language quickly so they can then succeed academically. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This study is the first attempt to look at a random sample of school districts across the state of Arizona under the 4-hour ELD block policy. The goal of the study is to better understand what are the positive aspects and the major challenges of implementing the 4-hour ELD block in Arizona. In particular this study aims to answer the following research questions: (1) How is the 4-hour ELD block being implemented? (2) What are the perceived benefits of the 4-hour ELD block for students and for schools? and (3) What are the district leaders’ concerns about implementing the 4-hour ELD block? Population/Participants/Subjects: Of the 65 school districts randomly selected as potential participants, 26 agreed to participate in this study. The district response rate of the study was 40%, and the informants were the English Language Coordinators (ELC), who are the individuals most knowledgeable about how the 4-hour ELD block is implemented in their district. The sample of school districts that participated in our study is representative of the state of Arizona in terms of enrollment patterns. Research Design: The researchers designed a phone survey for ELCs. Qualitative data analyses were used to examine the responses of the 26 ELCs. More specifically, a coding scheme was created to assist in the process of organizing and analyzing the data. Findings/Results: Analyses reveal that the vast majority of ELCs think that, as a result of the program, there is an increased focus on English Language Learner (ELL) students’ English language development. Regarding the challenges of the program, ELCs think that the implementation of the 4-hour ELD block has: a) neglected core areas of academic content that are critical for ELL students’ academic success, b) contributed to ELL students’ isolation, c) limited ELL students opportunities for on-time high school graduation, and d) assumed that English language learning can be accomplished within an unrealistic timeframe and under a set of unrealistic conditions. Conclusions/Recommendations: Given the data collected, we recommend that school districts explore alternative models of ELD instruction. These alternative models of ELD instruction need to take into consideration the local context of school districts, their resources, and existing research. Furthermore, we recommend that ELL students are offered additional programs or types of support that can help them become English proficient, while acquiring the academic content needed for succeeding in school. It seems reasonable to state that a combination of programs and support can be more effective than one prescriptive instructional approach. Finally, we recommend that school districts monitor progress and effectiveness by looking at multiple indicators. In particular, we strongly suggest that school districts keep track of reclassification, re-entry, and opting-out rates.

This shows that the phone use mostly takes place during times of the day when teenagers have social time and the use is not influenced by the availability of a computer. The phone makes the community access more private compared to the computer, but teens do share the use when they want to. The cell phone bridges the online and offline social communities and allows teens to participate in both at the same time. The online community is not only a place for social activity online; it is also a social activity offline that is carried out face-to-face with friends. Thus, the cell phone was a tool for the teens to combine their participation in the online and the offline world.

Literature shows that allocentric visual contexts in the animal’s background are critical for making conditional response selections during navigations. In a traditional maze task, however, it is difficult to identify exactly which subsets of visual contexts are critically used. In the current study, we tested in rats whether making conditional response selections required the hippocampus when using computer-generated visual contextual stimuli in the animal’s background as in primate and human studies. We designed a new task, visual contextual response selection (VCRS) task, in which the rat ran along a linear track and encountered a touchscreen monitor at the end of the track. The rat was required to touch one of the adjacent rectangular box images depending on the visual contextual stimuli displayed in the two peripheral monitors positioned on both sides of the center touchscreen monitor. The rats with a GABA-A receptor agonist, muscimol (MUS), infused bilaterally in the dorsal hippocampi showed severe performance deficits in the VCRS task and the impairment was completely reversible with vehicle injections. The impairment in contextual response selection with hippocampal inactivations occurred regardless of whether the visual context was presented in the side monitors or in the center touchscreen monitor. However, when the same visual contextual stimuli were pitted against each other between the two side monitors and as the rats simply ran toward the visual context associated with reward on a T-shaped track, hippocampal inactivations with MUS showed minimal disruptions, if any, in performance. Our results suggest that the hippocampus is critically involved in conditional response selection using visual stimuli in the background, but it is not required for the perceptual discrimination of those stimuli.

To inform public health approaches to influencing sedentary behaviors, an understanding of correlates is required. Methods: Participants were 2,199 adults aged 20–66 years living in King County/Seattle, WA, and Baltimore, MD, regions, recruited from neighborhoods high or low on a “walkability index” (derived from objective built environment indicators) and having high or low median incomes. Cross-sectional associations of walkability and income with total sedentary time (measured by accelerometers and by self-report) and with self-reported time in seven specific sitting-related behaviors were examined. Results: Neighborhood walkability and income were unrelated to measures of total sitting time. Lower neighborhood walkability was significantly associated with more driving time (difference of 18.2 min/day, p < .001) and more self-reported TV viewing (difference of 14.5 min/day, p < .001). Residents of higher income neighborhoods reported more computer/Internet and reading time, and they had more objectively measured sedentary time. Conclusions: Neighborhood walkability was not related to total sedentary time but was related to two specific sedentary behaviors associated with risk for obesity—driving time and TV viewing time. Future research could examine how these prevalent and often prolonged sedentary behaviors mediate relationships between neighborhood walkability and overweight/obesity. Initiatives to reduce chronic disease risk among residents of both higher-and lower-income low-walkable neighborhoods should include a focus on reducing TV viewing time and other sedentary behaviors and enacting policies that can lead to the development or redevelopment of more-walkable neighborhoods.

Several reviews of the psychological literature have shown that around 96% of papers involving the use of null hypothesis significance testing report significant outcomes for their main results but that the typical studies are insufficiently powerful for such a track record. We explain this paradox by showing that the use of several small underpowered samples often represents a more efficient research strategy (in terms of finding p < .05) than does the use of one larger (more powerful) sample. Publication bias and the most efficient strategy lead to inflated effects and high rates of false positives, especially when researchers also resorted to questionable research practices, such as adding participants after intermediate testing. We provide simulations that highlight the severity of such biases in meta-analyses. We consider 13 meta-analyses covering 281 primary studies in various fields of psychology and find indications of biases and/or an excess of significant results in seven. These results highlight the need for sufficiently powerful replications and changes in journal policies.

Individual levels of self-stigma may vary over time and fluctuate in response to both external/contextual (i.e., location, activity, social company) and internal (i.e., psychiatric symptoms, mood) factors. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between self-stigmatizing beliefs and these factors, as they occur in the daily life of individuals with schizophrenia. Methods: Mobile technologies were used to longitudinally track momentary levels of self-stigma, psychotic symptoms, negative affect, positive affect, activity, and immediate social and physical environment in 24 individuals with schizophrenia, multiple times daily, over a 1-week period. Results: Multilevel modeling showed that participants’ current activity was associated with changes in self-stigma (χ² = 10.53,  p < .05), but immediate location and social company were not. Time-lagged analyses found that increases in negative affect (β = 0.11, p < .01) and psychotic symptom severity (β = .16, p < .01) predicted increases in the intensity of self-stigmatizing beliefs. Psychotic symptoms were found to be both an antecedent and a consequence (β = 0.08, p < .01) of increased self-stigma. Conclusions: Our findings support a framework for understanding self-stigma as an experience that changes based on alterations in internal states and external circumstances. Mobile technologies are an effective methodology to study self-stigma and have potential to be used to deliver clinical interventions.

With Work’s Intimacy Melissa Gregg offers a close-up of white-collar workers in the creative, communication and information industries. The data presented in this monograph—collected between 2007 and 2009—provide a fascinating insight into how the use of new media technologies has shaped employees’ quotidian experience of work. This book consists of three main parts. Part I is entitled ‘The Connectivity Imperative: Business Responses to New Media’. Part II of the monograph deals with ‘Getting Intimate: Online Culture and the Rise of Social Networking’. Part III of Work’s Intimacy carries the title ‘Looking for Love in the Networked Household’. In many ways this book is a much-needed response to new-media evangelists who have highlighted solely the great opportunities that new media technology have brought us. Melissa Gregg shows clearly that the world of home offices, social networking sites and intensive smart phone use is not free from problems or inconveniences, and most notably it brings new kinds of pressure and expectations—both internally and externally imposed on the individual. This book is a valuable addition to a growing field of literature on work in the creative industries. One minor flaw of this monograph is that it is at times challenging to keep track of research participants who were introduced in a previous chapter and then referred to again in subsequent sections.

We test theories of norm enforcing and horizon expanding social networks and distinction by examining the relationship between daily smoking behavior and school organization. Using the 2007 Dutch National School Survey on Substance Use, we find that individual student characteristics are more important predictors than school characteristics. Importantly, social background effects are clearly mediated by school tracks, suggesting that tracking helps us to explain social gradients in substance use. However, school context plays almost no role in adolescent smoking behavior. One exception concerns students in the general track, for whom we find that smoking is further reduced when they are placed in the same school organization as students of the vocational track. This is in line with the theory that tracking differences are magnified in a context where interaction between students from different tracks is promoted.

After reviewing the brief history of this initiative in couple and family therapy research, the article presents the Systemic Therapy Inventory of Change (STIC), the first online multisystemic and multidimensional client-report system specifically designed to assess and track system change and the therapeutic alliance within client systems in family, couple and individual therapy. In addition to reliably and validly assessing and tracking client system and alliance change, the STIC System also feeds these data back to therapists and other clinical stakeholders on-demand over the entire course of therapy. Beyond presenting the STIC, the article describes the use of the STIC System as a clinical tool to enhance collaborative assessment, treatment planning, progress evaluation and termination in multisystemic psychotherapy. The article concludes with an extended case example of the treatment of an actual couple in which the STIC was used to empirically inform and facilitate collaboration during every stage of treatment. Screen shots from the Web site illustrate the clinical use of the STIC as a multisystemic treatment tool to bring science, technology, and the art of psychotherapy together to make therapy more efficient and effective.

However, it is unclear how Internet-based social networks might influence health. Chronic stress can have negative health consequences, and some data suggest that Facebook could be a new source of psychological stress. Thus, we examined undergraduate college student perceptions of Facebook use and incidence of upper respiratory infections (URIs). We hypothesized that subjects with more diverse networks (i.e., more friends on Facebook) would have fewer URIs than their less diverse counterparts; that subjects reporting Facebook-induced stress would be more susceptible to URIs; and that subjects with more diverse networks who report Facebook-induced stress would be less susceptible to URIs than subjects with less diverse social networks who reported Facebook-induced stress. In this prospective study, healthy college students completed online questionnaires that assessed use and perceptions of Facebook and technology, and then were interviewed weekly for 10 weeks to track incidence of URL URI episodes were defined by a symptom-based criterion. The social network size was significantly related to the rate of URI, such that, the larger the social network, the greater the incidence rate of URI. Most (85.7 percent) respondents experienced some degree of Facebook-induced stress. The effects of Facebook-induced stress on incidence of URI varied across the social network size, such that, the impact of stress on the URI incidence rate increased with the size of the social network. These results are largely in contrast to our hypotheses, but clearly suggest an association between Facebook use, psychological stress, and health.

In this study we investigated how objectively measured one-year changes in physical activity may be associated with school-related factors in 9- to 10-year-old British children. Methods: Data were analysed from 839 children attending 89 schools in the SPEEDY (Sport, Physical Activity, and Eating behaviours: Environmental Determinants in Young People) study. Outcomes variables were one year changes in objectively measured sedentary, moderate, and vigorous physical activity, with baseline measures taken when the children were 9–10 years old. School characteristics hypothesised to be associated with change in physical activity were identified from questionnaires, grounds audits, and computer mapping. Associations were examined using simple and multivariable multilevel regression models for both school (9 am –3 pm) and travel (8–9 am and 3–4 pm) time. Results: Significant associations during school time included the length of the morning break which was found to be supportive of moderate (β coefficient: 0.68 [p: 0.003]) and vigorous (β coefficient: 0.52 [p: 0.002]) activities and helps to prevent adverse changes in sedentary time (β coefficient: -2.52 [p: 0.001]). During travel time, positive associations were found between the presence of safe places to cross roads around the school and changes in moderate (β coefficient: 0.83 [p:0.022]) and vigorous (β coefficient: 0.56 [p:0.001]) activity, as well as sedentary time (β coefficient: -1.61 [p:0.005]). Conclusion: This study suggests that having longer morning school breaks and providing road safety features such as cycling infrastructure, a crossing guard, and safe places for children to cross the road may have a role to play in supporting the maintenance of moderate and vigorous activity behaviours, and preventing the development of sedentary behaviours in children.

To date, numerous studies on the educational use of multiuser virtual environments have been reported in the literature. However, among studies on virtual-world-based courses, our investigation was one of the firsts to employ learning outcomes (rather than affective states) that were objectively measured (rather than subjectively reported) against a control group.

Therefore, we drew the data for this study from the Faculty Perceptions of Intercollegiate Athletics Survey conducted in April and May 2007 for the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics. The survey, developed by the authors with input from an advisory group of faculty involved in national reforms of intercollegiate athletics, focuses on the governance, financial, and academic aspects of college sports. Governance items inquire about campus norms supporting shared decision-making in academic and athletic matters, athletics-specific oversight roles, campus leadership—including the president and athletics administrators—and off-campus groups such as the media that might shape decisions. The survey was distributed online to faculty at 23 universities belonging to the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division 1-A). We randomly selected two institutions from each of the 11 Football Bowl Subdivision conferences and one from the independent schools. Using publicly available online and paper campus directories, we drew a purposive sample of 13,604 faculty from the 23 universities to maximize the representation of faculty with campus governance involvement and with experience teaching student-athletes. A total of 3,005 individuals completed the survey, for a response rate of 23 percent. Adjusted for those who did not fully complete the survey, faculty on sabbatical, emeritus faculty, and non-tenure-track faculty, and administrators inadvertently included, the final sample size is 2,071. The final sample for analysis is 1,995 after removing individuals with missing data on key variables. Along with formalization and centralization, prior studies indicate that resource constraints increase the use of political tactics. Our investigation showed that faculty who were dissatisfied with the financial circumstances of their department and campus were more likely to perceive an athletics in-group working through various channels to promote their interests. As was the case at UC Berkeley, these findings suggest that, when competition for resources intensifies—and begins to impinge on their daily work lives—complacent faculty may become more vigilant about athletics budgeting and perhaps more active in local and national reform efforts.

Give yourself a moment to ponder just how bizarre intimate sex through copulation is: one individual inserts a part of its anatomy into a delicate part of another individual. In The Dawn of the Deed, paleoarcheologist John Long encourages the reader to examine the oddity of sexual intercourse. He depicts this peculiarity by illustrating that somewhere along the phylogenetic tree, a male of some archaic species physically penetrated his female counterpart. What a strange occurrence that must have been! Inspired by his discovery of the oldest-known fossil demonstrating internal fertilization, Materpiscis attenboroughi, Long takes the reader on a journey through the evolution of sexual reproduction. He uses the discovery of the embryo found within Masterpiscis attenboroughi as a starting point for a detailed account of the sexual anatomy and behavior of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, primates and, eventually, humans. Using a combination of evidence found in living species as well as clues preserved in the fossil record, Long provides a thorough account of how and why sexual reproduction might have evolved the way that it did. Complimenting this detailed history of sexual reproduction is Ogas and Gaddam's A Billion Wicked Thoughts. The authors ingeniously use the internet as a digital fossil record to track the footprints of human desire. Drawing their information from millions of individual searches tracked and collected from search engine databases, the authors present unique evidence of the most common—and some of the stranger—sexual desires and preferences. Using this archival information as an unintended survey on human sexuality, Ogas and Gaddam entertain the reader with statistics derived from these searches, in conjunction with personal anecdotes. Using this creative and unique approach, Ogas and Gaddam address the sexual content sought out by each sex, and discuss the adaptive problems such preferences might have solved over human evolutionary history. To conclude, we recommend both The Dawn of the Deed and A Billion Wicked Thoughts for anyone interested in the science of sex. Long expertly guides the reader through the evolution of sexual reproduction, providing a plethora of examples from extant species and the fossil record. Long's book provides a clearly constructed journey of the phylogeny of sex. His technique of ending chapters with cliff-hanging questions is an effective tool for holding the reader’s attention from one chapter to the next. Each question posed is thoroughly investigated in the next chapter. With discussions ranging from barnacle penises and oral sex in female catfishes to traumatic insemination in bed bugs, this is an entertaining and fulfilling read. As for A Billion Wicked Thoughts, Ogas and Gaddam cleverly examine sexual desires through the content that is searched for on the internet. The authors accurately discuss the sexual preferences and desires of each sex, while also providing the reader with a reasonable overview of the diversity of human sexual desires. Using evolution by natural selection to explain human sexual desires and preferences, Ogas and Gaddam highlight that these desires and preferences have evolved to solve adaptive problems recurrently faced over human evolutionary history. A provocative and informative read, the book showcases the fact that although there are universal psychological adaptations that generate human sexual desires, the output of these adaptations is manifested in a remarkable array of sexual diversity.

"PZLQ7VQW","thesis","2013","Johnson, Roy","Community college first-year business student online course motivation","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1373445303?accountid=14026","The purpose of this case study was to explore the online learning environment through the experiences of the individual learner and to gain more insight into the elements of Business online courses, as framed by the Keller ARCS Model of Motivation. This study explored the following three Research Questions: 1. How do undergraduate first-year Business students perceive online course elements as being motivational? 2. How do the online courses that Business students perceive as being motivational use the Keller ARCS Motivational Model? 3 How do exemplary online Business faculty use the Keller ARCS Motivational Model in online instruction? The population was students enrolled in first-year for-credit online classes taken during the Fall 2010 semester in a Midwestern community college. A sample of required Business online sections was purposively selected in order to investigate Business student motivation. The participants in this study were 18 first-year Business students enrolled in Business courses. Based on student interviews, the instructors of the three courses that were most often nominated by students as being most motivational were interviewed. Interviews of students and instructors were conducted at the end of the Fall 2010 semester. Seven themes were identified for Research Question 1: 116 units for theme ""Course Communication,"" 83 units for theme ""Course Requirements,"" 71 units for theme ""Grades,"" 60 units for theme ""Course Organization,"" 50 units for the theme ""Learning Online,"" 48 units or the theme ""Course Element Availability,"" and 46 units for the theme ""Track Course Progress."" For Research Question 2, the ARCS model categories were used as a framework for understanding and interpreting student motivation: ""Attention,"" ""Relevance,"" ""Confidence,"" and ""Satisfaction."" The components of the Keller ARCS themes were then analyzed according to the components that students perceived as being most motivational. The ARCS Themes found were: 31 units for theme ""Satisfaction,"" 25 units for theme ""Relevance,"" 24 units were found for theme ""Confidence,"" and 20 units were found for theme ""Attention."" The significant theme findings were: The Satisfaction theme was found to include practice prior to graded activities. The Relevance theme was found to include the use of ""choices"" as a key motivational component to what was perceived as being relevant. The Confidence theme was found to include a progression in difficulty of activities and access to review and practice new material. The Attention theme was found to include variability of instruction and course elements. To answer Research Question 3, faculty interviews focused specifically on the Keller ARCS Motivational Model and components. The ARCS themes found were: 36 units for theme ""Confidence,"" 25 units for theme ""Relevance,"" 24 units for theme ""Satisfaction,"" and 22 units for theme ""Attention."" The significant findings from the themes were: The Confidence theme was found to include providing key information upfront to students. The design of the course must allow for student success and become progressively more difficult for students. Also, the time and effort required to complete activities should be provided to students. The Relevance theme was found to include the use of ""choices"" and to relate the course to the student's situation as key motivational components. The Satisfaction theme was found to include negative consequences that are handled within the course, and practice that offers immediate feedback. The Attention theme was found to include students asking students questions within the course. Recommendations for further studies included a qualitative study to uncover how online Business students are motivated in their second and later years and a study to understand student motivation through various settings and technologies used in learning management system course elements.

This dissertation investigates the use of BL with ESL writing students in an intensive English program. The purpose was to investigate how to prepare ESL teachers to create a productive BL environment for their ESL writing students. This includes an investigation of how to best train the teachers in BL pedagogy and online teaching technology and a measure of the students' perceptions of the BL environment with respect to its productiveness. Finally, the study sought to discover how students experienced the teacher's practice and behavior and the extent to which these factors affected student perceptions of the course and BL environment in general. A mixed-methods approach was employed which involved quantitative and qualitative data collection from 41 ESL students and five ESL teachers. The teachers were trained in BL pedagogy and given pedagogical and technical support throughout the semester, after which both students and teachers were given questionnaires and were interviewed in order to determine their experiences in the BL environment. The findings indicate that the teachers needed a fairly minimal amount of pedagogical and technical training to employ BL successfully. Collaborative planning also proved very beneficial, together with technical and pedagogical support throughout the semester. Students were found to work more autonomously and focused while becoming more responsible for their own learning. This enabled the teachers to better provide personalized assistance, keep better track of student progress, and cover more materials. Students also liked learning in the BL environment and indicated they would prefer this to more conventional classes. Lastly, teacher practice and behavior was found to have minimal influence on student perceptions of the BL environment though some results suggested that teacher experience might be a predictor of student satisfaction with their teachers.

"JVLE8D6H","thesis","2013","Oberoi, Sharad V.","Towards a framework to support engineering design student projects","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1399053264?accountid=14026","The first research question of this thesis addresses the problem of information management in engineering design projects. The students' design deliberations, as externalized in their discussion threads and through the documents they create or reference, can be visualized by mining the textual evidence they produce as natural part of their collaboration process. By using computational linguistic techniques and machine learning, all the documents and student discussion threads are aggregated, and a sample concept-map based graphical representation is created that can be used to navigate the project corpus. This approach is referred to as DesignWebs. DesignWebs can be viewed as an assemblage of related noun phrases reveal the current state of the project and the underlying structure of the design. DesignWebs assist as navigation aids in contextualizing and viewing project archives by structuring the design information as graphs of related entities. The second research question presents noun phrases as a surrogate measure for design team dynamics. This question builds on prior research about using noun phrases as objective measure for measuring design team performance (Mabogunje 1997), and uses them for exploring how the design vocabulary of student teams expands and contracts during a design project. The expansion and contraction reflect the students brainstorming about different design alternatives for the project and finalizing certain design solutions respectively. This question also shows that tracking the noun phrases as they are introduced by one team and shared across team boundaries can reveal insights about whether the teams are successfully collaborating. Tracking the design vocabulary over time shows how the design vocabulary related to a team's assigned tasks keeps on getting refined as the project progresses, reflecting the domain expertise gained by the team. The shared vocabulary between teams also mirrors the project's work-flow, as it is represented in the artifact's system architecture diagram. Finally this question shows how instructors can see the changes in a team's design knowledge by monitoring its DesignWebs, as they are created at different milestones during the project. The third research question presents DesignWebs as a research framework that facilitates the validation of prior research findings about the functioning and assessment of design project teams by obviating the tedious data pre-processing steps. Three diverse research studies are examined to demonstrate the wide applicability of DesignWebs as a platform: the first examines whether using the semantic coherence of student communications in team-based project courses can act as an indicator of the progress of the design process (Song et al. 2003); the second examines whether applying metrics on the ""communication artifacts"" generated by computer supported collaborative tools can provide insights into the design process that created them (Dutoit 1996); the third explores various individual and group work processes that when made more explicit to instructors can assist them in carrying out the assessment processes (Gweon 2008). This research contributes to supporting engineering design student projects by presenting a framework that organizes and evaluates a variety of potential metrics and design assessment measures based on the text products in a given project corpus. It also presents an interface that summarizes the team's online communications and documentation to track the emergence of the shared solution and extent of team collaboration, using noun phrases as a surrogate measure. Finally, this research presents a research test bed that brings together a number of research hypotheses related to collaborative design projects by demonstrating that they can complement the instructors' understanding of how teams are working.

Einstein's theory of special relativity, Rutherford's glimpse into the invisible heart of the atom—such astonishing breakthroughs seem almost magical—like bolts of insight arising from nowhere.  Genius Unmasked reveals the true nature of genius, taking the reader on a journey through the lives and minds of more than a dozen brilliant scientists, ranging from Darwin, Einstein, Edison, and Pasteur, to lesser known but important innovators as Maria Montessori. Their stories are truly compelling, and at time inspiring, but, more important, Roberta Ness uses these stories to highlight a cognitive tool box that anyone can employ. Ness, an authority on innovation, outlines eleven basic strategies—including finding the right question, observation, analogy, changing point of view, dissection, reorganization, the power of groups, and frame shifting. Beginning with Charles Darwin, who left behind a voluminous trail of writing that preserved his thinking process, Ness illuminates his use of all eleven tools. Indeed, for each genius, she combines a fascinating narrative of their creative work with an astute analysis of how they used particular tools to achieve their breakthroughs. We see how Ancel Keys, the father of the Mediterranean diet, used the ""power of groups""—enlisting a team of statisticians, nutritionists, physiologists, and physicians—to track the health benefits of exercise and diet. How Paul Baran conceived packet switching—the idea that made the internet possible—through analogy with the neurological networks of the brain. And how Maria Montessori overturned the conventional frame of thinking about the role of children in education. Genius Unmasked shows how the most creative minds in science used tools that can help us improve our creative abilities. Geniuses are not omnipotent. They are just very skilled at employing the creativity toolbox highlighted in this book.

In particular, this study focused on teachers' technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) and their integration of dynamic geometry in the classroom instruction. The sources of data included: an initial interview, observations, documents, a closing interview, a survey, implementation questionnaires, professional development attendance records and the researcher's log. Data analysis utilized the TPACK Development Model to describe participants' dynamic geometry integration and to identify their TPACK development levels. All participants displayed good knowledge of geometry content, although they did not always know how to connect it with their pedagogical and technological knowledge. TPACK development levels were identified through the descriptions of participants' TPACK development and enactment. The levels varied within the themes and their descriptors for each participant; however, overall TPACK development levels were identified for three participants—two at the adapting level and one at the exploring level. The TPACK levels for the fourth participant were consistent only for the teaching theme descriptors and were at the exploring level. Three unexpected findings surfaced. First, the participant with least teaching experience displayed the highest levels of TPACK. Second, the participant with most teaching experience with dynamic geometry showed the most inconsistency among the TPACK development levels, ranging from recognizing to exploring. Third, ongoing professional development and easy access to computers did not translate to frequent incorporation of dynamic geometry in teaching and learning. The participants claimed the curriculum and standardized testing to be the main barriers to increased technology use. Findings suggested that participants developed their TPACK through attending professional development workshops and implementing what they learned in the classroom instruction. Based on those findings, this study proposed a professional development model designed for teachers interested in integrating dynamic geometry in the classroom instruction.

"ZZS9NXID","thesis","2013","Chen, Hongyu","Two essays on the generative view of modeling user-generated contents","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1428017236?accountid=14026","We examine two issues on business applications of user-generated contents (UGC). First, UGC such as online reviews are always inherently incomplete since we cannot know the opinions of users who do not write a review. These silent users may have systematically different online experiences than those who speak up. These differences can be driven by users' differing sentiments towards their online experiences as well as their disposition to generate UGC. Indiscriminately aggregating UGC across different sentiment levels can lead to an aggregation bias and overlooking the silent users' opinions can result in a reporting bias. We develop a method to rectify these two biases simultaneously through an inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach. In the context of users' movie review activities at Blockbuster.com, we found that the average probability for a customer to post a review is 0.06 when the customer is unsatisfied with the movie, 0.23 when indifferent, and 0.32 when satisfied. A user's reporting probability with positive experience first order stochastically dominates the one with negative experience. We then adjust common UGC measures such as review volume and sentiment using these estimated reporting probabilities as weights. We show that these rectified measures yield superior predictive power, as opposed to the raw ones. Our proposed approach provides a realistic solution for business managers to paint a more complete picture from the inherently incomplete UGC. Second, we investigate how to extract customer sentiments from UGC. While most UGC are text-based, quantified sentiment scores are not always readily available as in Amazon reviews. The use of computer programs meant to extract users' opinions provides a viable manner to systematically access a large amount of customers' opinions, as part of sentiment analysis. Unfortunately, existing sentiment mining algorithms focus only on text analysis, disregarding the personality or disposition of the creator of the content. A case in point is cynical persons that typically have negative opinions. In this dissertation, we propose a user-oriented, probabilistic generative model for UGC. Hereby, sentiment labeling is performed in view of both texts and the users' past sentiments. We test the model using a review data set provided by Blockbuster.com. The method proposed herein consistently performs at above 85% accuracy and outperforms the traditional naïve Bayesian approach. Our method particularly applies for dataset collected from UGC platforms such as Twitter, Facebook or blogs, especially if each user has a track record.

This research examines how supportive exchanges—emotional support giving and receiving—affects psychosocial health outcomes. More specifically, this study examines the conditions under which supportive exchanges have beneficial psychosocial health outcomes. This research also includes an examination of the antecedent characteristics that influence the amount of social support one gives, seeks and receives within online support groups. These factors include demographics, disease-related factors, and psychosocial factors. Finally, this study argues that the notion of opinion leaders can be another crucial factor in explaining the underlying positive relationship between social support and health outcomes. Therefore, this study investigates the relationship between opinion leaders and psychosocial health outcomes by considering two overarching questions: 1) Who are the opinion leaders? 2) What role do these opinion leaders play in explaining health outcomes within CMSS groups? The data analyzed in this study resulted from merging human-coded content analysis of discussion group messages, action log data analyses of interactive health system usage and multi-wave survey data. Surveys were administered at multiple time points to 221 women with breast cancer who were provided free access and training for how to use the computer-mediated support group developed by the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) project. This study found that supportive exchanges of receiving and giving play positive, but different roles in predicting psychosocial health outcomes. This study also showed that those who believe that they are capable of communicating with physicians or health care providers and those who lack emotional processing are more likely to seek emotional support from others. The results also revealed that opinion leaders had more psychosocial health benefits, such as higher levels of cancer information competence, breast cancer knowledge, bonding, and better problem-focused coping strategies (i.e., active coping and planning) than non-leaders. Implications for fields of research and improving psychosocial interventions for people with health concerns are discussed, and future research objectives are suggested.

"AJFTESES","thesis","2013","Matveyev, Egor V.","Essays on corporate governance and the labor market for corporate directors","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1442391169?accountid=14026","This thesis consists of two essays that examine issues related to the labor market for corporate directors and executive compensation. The first chapter develops and estimates an equilibrium model that identifies the key factors explaining the allocation of directors across firms. The approach is based on a two-sided matching model that allows an identification of director and appointing firm preferences. The findings indicate that directors' choices are driven by their desire to expand their social network. Likewise, firms choose directors that increase the connectedness of their boards the most. The model is used to estimate the compensating differentials needed to attract directors with more attractive skill levels and higher quality connections. The evidence also suggests that CEO directors have lower propensity to expand their network, and choose firms with better records of recent performance. The performance of a CEO's firm does not affect his future prospects in the labor market for directorships. Second chapter examines the relation between executive and director compensation at the firm level. After controlling for monitoring proxies and manager-specific heterogeneity, there is no evidence of significant correlation between the excess compensation of directors and executives, contrary to previous research. The observed high levels of correlation between executive and director compensation are driven by underlying positive assortative matching between executive and director talent. Top-quality managers retain exceptional directors, and better directors choose to work for executives with excellent track records. This is consistent with a theory that assumes complementarity in production between director and executive skills.

Adaptive mixed reality rehabilitation (AMRR) is a novel integration of motion capture technology and high-level media computing that provides precise kinematic measurements and engaging multimodal feedback for self-assessment during a therapeutic task. The AMRR system was evaluated in a small (N=3) cohort of stroke survivors to determine best practices for administering adaptive, media-based therapy. A proof of concept study followed, examining changes in clinical scale and kinematic performances among a group of stroke survivors who received either a month of AMRR therapy (N = 11) or matched dosing of traditional repetitive task therapy (N = 10). Both groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements in Wolf Motor Function Test and upper-extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment scores, indicating increased function after the therapy. However, only participants who received AMRR therapy showed a consistent improvement in their kinematic measurements, including those measured in the trained reaching task (reaching to grasp a cone) and in an untrained reaching task (reaching to push a lighted button). These results suggest that that the AMRR system can be used as a therapy tool to enhance both functionality and reaching kinematics that quantify movement quality. Additionally, the AMRR concepts are currently being transitioned to a home-based training application. An inexpensive, easy-to-use, toolkit of tangible objects has been developed to sense, assess and provide feedback on hand function during different functional activities. These objects have been shown to accurately and consistently track hand function in people with unimpaired movements and will be tested with stroke survivors in the future.

"AYJNEBXI","thesis","2013","Achrekar, Harshavardhan","Online social network flu tracker: A novel sensory approach to predict flu trends","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1499090822?accountid=14026","Seasonal influenza epidemics cause several million cases of illnesses cases and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year. Other pandemics like the 1918 ""Spanish Flu"" may change into devastating event. Reducing the impact of these threats is of paramount importance for health authorities, and studies have shown that effective interventions can be taken to contain the epidemics, if early detection can be made. In this thesis, we introduce Social Network Enabled Flu Trends (SNEFT), a continuous data collection framework which monitors flu related messages on online social networks (OSN's) such as Twitter and Facebook and track the emergence and spread of influenza within United States across different regions and among different age groups. We expect these flu related messages posted by OSN users to be highly correlated to the number of Influenza like Illness (ILI) cases provided by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We attempt to validate our model by measuring how well it fits the CDC ILI rates over a course of two years from 2009 to 2011. We show that text mining significantly enhances the correlation between OSN data and the ILI rates. For accurate prediction, we implemented an auto-regression with exogenous input (ARX) model which uses current OSN data and CDC ILI rates from previous weeks to predict current influenza statistics. Our results show that, while previous ILI data from the CDC offer a true (but delayed) assessment of a flu epidemic, OSN data provides a real-time assessment of the current epidemic condition and can be used to compensate for the lack of current ILI data. We observe that the OSN data is highly correlated with the ILI rates across different regions within USA and can be used to effectively improve the accuracy of our prediction. Therefore, OSN data can act as supplementary indicator to gauge influenza levels within the population and helps to discover flu trends ahead of CDC. Using our approach to achieve faster, near real time prediction of the emergence and spread of influenza epidemic, through continuous tracking of flu related OSN messages originating within United States, we intend to provide a snapshot of the current epidemic condition and a preview of what to expect, on a daily basis. This would significantly enhances public health awareness and preparedness against the influenza epidemic and other large scale pandemics.

In this area, affective computing had demonstrated significant benefits for the patients. Affective computing is the area of development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human The more modern branch of computer science originated with Rossalind Picard's 1995 paper on affective computing. A motivation for this area of research is the ability to simulate empathy. The machine should interpret the emotional state of humans and adapt its behavior to them, giving an appropriate response for these emotions. In e-learning applications, affective computing can be used to adjust the presentation style of a computerized tutor when a learner is bored, interested, frustrated, or pleased. Psychological health services, i.e. counseling, benefit from affective computing applications when determining client's emotional state. Affective computing sends a message via color or sound to express an emotional state to others. Robotic systems capable of processing affective information exhibit higher flexibility while one works in uncertain or complex environments. Companion devices, such as digital pets that use affective computing abilities to enhance realism and provide a higher degree of autonomy. Other potential applications are centered on social monitoring. For example, in a group therapy it can monitor the emotion of all participants and engage in additional measures, such as alerting, concentration and empathy. Affective computing has potential applications in human computer interaction, such as affective mirrors allowing the user to see how he or she performs; emotion monitoring agents sending a warning before one sends an angry email; or even music players selecting tracks based on mood. One idea, put forth by the Romanian researcher Dr. Nicu Sebe in an interview, is the analysis of a person's face while they are using a certain therapy. Averaging the results obtained on a large group of subjects, one can tell whether that therapy has the desired effect and what the elements which interest the watcher are. Affective computing is also being applied to the development of communicative skills, because the ability to express and recognize emotions is a fundamental element for diagnosis of depression of Alzheimer's Disease. And also, for this reason researchers have discovered some strategies to achieve the principal symptoms of depression that can be forgotten and forsaken, when emotional needs of the patients are satisfied. We believe that scientists need to start probing the benefits of applying affective computing for enrichment of behavioral treatments in elderly with depression of Alzheimer's Disease. In this chapter, we review some recent research on the role of the affective computing applied to this field.

The data showed students’ daily academic use of their personal computers was significantly lower compared with their non-academic use. There was also no obvious relationship found when comparing overall computer use with course assignment schedules. In addition, students’ perceived use of personal computers as captured through self-reports was found to be contrary to their actual use as recorded by the computer monitoring software. The low level of use for academic purposes indicates that the personal computers did not play a significant role in the daily study practices of these students and that the current perceptions that such devices are vital to student learning may be unsound.

As these systems become more standardized, we are able to make comparisons across regions and support national advocacy efforts. In the past, setting up MIS programs was too costly and required too much technical expertise to be considered a viable option for the school social. worker Now, computers with sufficient storage capacity (memory) and processing speed (RAM) have become affordable. Further, computer programs have grown from basic spreadsheet applications for accounting to user-friendly database applications. Because database applications like Microsoft Access are often part of basic software packages, many districts already possess the software needed. The creation and use of MIS is no longer beyond the reach of the school social work community. The goal of this chapter is to provide the practicing school social worker with a step-by-step approach to the creation of an MIS.

An exploratory pilot study tested this remote communication system with 10 pairs of participants who were exposed to two experimental conditions characterised by two different modes of synchronisation between the two robots that each interacts locally with the participant. In one mode, the robots incrementally affected each other’s behaviour, while in the other, the robots mirrored each other’s behaviour. Instruments used in this study include questionnaires, video observations and log files for the game state. The authors used various techniques to measure engagement and synchronization such as quantitative (e.g. rate of occurrence and average values) as well as qualitative measurements. In an exploratory data analysis, these multiple sources of data reflecting participant performance and characteristics were analyzed. Significant correlations were found and presented between the participants as well as participants’ preferences and overall acceptance of such communication media. Findings indicate that participants preferred the mirroring mode, and that in this pilot study, robot-assisted remote communication was considered desirable and acceptable to the participants. Furthermore, the existence of interaction variations among different demographic groups was found, while this chapter lists and interprets the most significant effects.

For example, contemporary performance analysis enables elite sports people and coaches to obtain live feedback of match statistics and video sequences using flexible internet systems: systems that have become an indispensible tool for all those involved in high performance sport.  The Routledge Handbook of Sports Performance Analysis is the most comprehensive guide to this exciting and dynamic branch of sport science ever to be published. The book explores performance analysis across the four main contexts in which it is commonly used: support for coaches and athletes; the media; judging sport contests; and academic research. It offers an up-to-date account of methodological advances in PA research, assesses the evidence underpinning contemporary theories of sport performance, and reviews developments in applied PA across a wide range of sports, from soccer to track and field athletics. Covering every important aspect of PA, including tactics, strategy, mechanical aspects of technique, physical aspects of performance such as work-rate, coach behaviour and referee behaviour, this is an essential reference for any serious student, researcher or practitioner working in sport performance analysis, sport coaching or high performance sport.

Neighbourhood walkability is consistently shown to be associated with walking and total activity. Campaigns may have different effects on individuals living in high and low walkable neighbourhoods. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to compare pre- and post-campaign cognitive and behavioural impacts of the Heart Foundation’s Find Thirty every day® campaign, in respondents living in high and lower walkable neighbourhoods. Methods: Pre- and post-campaign cross-sectional survey data were linked with objectively measured neighbourhood walkability. Cognitive and behavioural impacts were assessed using logistic regression stratified by walkability. Results: Cognitive impacts were significantly higher post-campaign and consistently higher in respondents in high compared with lower walkable neighbourhoods. Post campaign sufficient activity was significantly higher and transport walking significantly lower, but only in residents of lower walkable areas. Conclusions: Cognitive impacts of mass media physical activity campaigns may be enhanced by living in a more walkable neighbourhood.

This challenge has focused some interest on DNA as an attractive target for information storage because of its capacity for high-density information encoding, longevity under easily achieved conditions and proven track record as an information bearer. Previous DNA-based information storage approaches have encoded only trivial amounts of information or were not amenable to scaling-up, and used no robust error-correction and lacked examination of their cost-efficiency for large-scale information archival. Here we describe a scalable method that can reliably store more information than has been handled before. We encoded computer files totalling 739 kilobytes of hard-disk storage and with an estimated Shannon information of 5.2 × 10⁶ bits into a DNA code, synthesized this DNA, sequenced it and reconstructed the original files with 100% accuracy. Theoretical analysis indicates that our DNA-based storage scheme could be scaled far beyond current global information volumes and offers a realistic technology for large-scale, long-term and infrequently accessed digital archiving. In fact, current trends in technological advances are reducing DNA synthesis costs at a pace that should make our scheme cost-effective for sub-50-year archiving within a decade.

Text messaging is a promising platform for improving chronic disease self-management in low-income populations, yet is largely unexplored in ADHF. Objective: The purpose of this pre-post study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a text message–based (SMS: short message service) intervention in a largely African American population with ADHF and explore its effects on self-management. Methods: Hospitalized patients with ADHF were enrolled in an automated text message–based heart failure program for 30 days following discharge. Messages provided self-care reminders and patient education on diet, symptom recognition, and health care navigation. Demographic and cell phone usage data were collected on enrollment, and an exit survey was administered on completion. The Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) was administered preintervention and postintervention and compared using sample  t tests (composite) and Wilcoxon rank sum tests (individual). Clinical data were collected through chart abstraction. Results: Of 51 patients approached for recruitment, 27 agreed to participate and 15 were enrolled (14 African-American, 1 White). Barriers to enrollment included not owning a personal cell phone (n = 12), failing the Mini-Mental exam (n = 3), needing a proxy (n = 2), hard of hearing (n = 1), and refusal (n = 3). Another 3 participants left the study for health reasons and 3 others had technology issues. A total of 6 patients (5 African-American, 1 White) completed the postintervention surveys. The mean age was 50 years (range 23-69) and over half had Medicaid or were uninsured (60%, 9/15). The mean ejection fraction for those with systolic dysfunction was 22%, and at least two-thirds had a prior hospitalization in the past year. Participants strongly agreed that the program was easy to use (83%), reduced pills missed (66%), and decreased salt intake (66%). Maintenance (mean composite score 49 to 78, P = .003) and management (57 to 86, P = .002) improved at 4 weeks, whereas confidence did not change (57 to 75, P = .11). Of the 6 SCHFI items that showed a statistically significant improvement, 5 were specifically targeted by the texting intervention. Conclusions: Over half of ADHF patients in an urban, largely African American community were eligible and interested in participating in a text messaging program following discharge. Access to mobile phones was a significant barrier that should be addressed in future interventions. Among the participants who completed the study, we observed a high rate of satisfaction and preliminary evidence of improvements in heart failure self-management.

The results indicate that the characteristics of consumers who have a greater propensity to conduct online product research but a lower tendency to post online product reviews differ substantially from those who are more likely to post online product reviews but less likely to conduct online product research. The research is important because the degree to which consumers who conduct online product research are similar to those who post online product reviews can be used to track the effectiveness of online word-of-mouth marketing campaigns.

Despite the growing availability of a range of health-related apps on the market, academic research on the development and evaluation of such apps is in the relatively early stages. A few existing studies have explored the views of various populations on using mobile phones for health-related issues and some studies are beginning to report user feedback on specific apps. However, there remains little in depth research on users’(and potential users’) experiences and views on a wide range of features and technologies that apps are, or will soon be, capable of. In particular, research on young adults is lacking, which is an unfortunate omission considering that this group comprises of a good number of mobile technology adoptors. Objective: The current study sought to explore young adults’ perspectives on apps related to health behavior change. It sought their experiences and views of features that might support health behavior change and issues that contribute to interest in and willingness to use such apps. Methods: Four focus groups were conducted with 19 students and staff at a University in the United Kingdom. Participants included 13 females and 6 males with a mean age of 23.79 (SD 7.89). The focus group discussions centred on participants’ experiences of using smartphone apps to support a healthy lifestyle, and their interest in and feelings about features and capabilities of such apps. The focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Study findings suggested that young, currently healthy adults have some interest in apps that attempt to support health-related behavior change. Accuracy and legitimacy, security, effort required, and immediate effects on mood emerged as important influences on app usage. The ability to record and track behavior and goals and the ability to acquire advice and information “on the go” were valued. Context-sensing capabilities and social media features tended to be considered unnecessary and off-putting. Conclusions: This study provided insight into the opportunities and challenges involved in delivering health-related behavioral interventions through smartphone apps. The findings suggested a number of valued features and characteristics that app developers may wish to consider when creating health behavior apps. Findings also highlighted several major challenges that appeared to need further consideration and research to ensure the development of effective and well-accepted behavior change apps.

This study provides the first test of the criterion validity of measures of Facebook frequency by comparing self-reported time spent on the site and number of logins against actual usage as measured by computer monitoring software. A sample of 45 college students installed software that monitored their computer usage for 1 month. There was a strong positive correlation between self-reported and actual time spent on Facebook; however, there was a significant discrepancy between the two. Students spent an average of 26 min ( SD = 30) per day on Facebook, significantly lower than the average of 145 ( SD = 111) minutes per day obtained through self-report. There was a moderate relationship between number of logins and actual time spent on Facebook.

Although efforts to reduce mother-to-child transmission are underway, obtaining complete and accurate data from rural clinical sites to track progress presents a major challenge. Objective: To describe the acceptability and feasibility of mobile phones as a tool for clinic-based face-to-face data collection with pregnant women living with HIV in South Africa. Methods: As part of a larger clinic-based trial, 16 interviewers were trained to conduct mobile phone–assisted personal interviews (MPAPI). These interviewers (participant group 1) completed the same short questionnaire based on items from the Technology Acceptance Model at 3 different time points. Questions were asked before training, after training, and 3 months after deployment to clinic facilities. In addition, before the start of the primary intervention trial in which this substudy was undertaken, 12 mothers living with HIV (MLH) took part in a focus group discussion exploring the acceptability of MPAPI (participant group 2). Finally, a sample of MLH (n = 512) enrolled in the primary trial were asked to assess their experience of being interviewed by MPAPI (participant group 3). Results: Acceptability of the method was found to be high among the 16 interviewers in group 1. Perceived usefulness was reported to be slightly higher than perceived ease of use across the 3 time points. After 3 months of field use, interviewer perceptions of both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness were found to be higher than before training. The feasibility of conducting MPAPI interviews in this setting was found to be high. Network coverage was available in all clinics and hardware, software, cost, and secure transmission to the data center presented no significant challenges over the 21-month period. For the 12 MHL participants in group 2, anxiety about the multimedia capabilities of the phone was evident. Their concern centered on the possibility that their privacy may be invaded by interviewers using the mobile phone camera to photograph them. For participants in group 3, having the interviewer sit beside vs across from the interviewee during the MPAPI interview was received positively by 94.7% of MHL. Privacy (6.3%) and confidentiality (5.3%) concerns were low for group 3 MHL. Conclusions: Mobile phones were found both to be acceptable and feasible in the collection of maternal and child health data from women living with HIV in South Africa.

The objective of this paper was to assess the possible mediation role of energy balance-related behaviors in the association between parental education and children’s body composition. Methods: Data were obtained from the cross sectional study of the “EuropeaN Energy balance Research to prevent excessive weight Gain among Youth” (ENERGY) project. 2121 boys and 2516 girls aged 10 to 12 from Belgium, Greece, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia and Spain were included in the analyses. Data were obtained via questionnaires assessing obesity related dietary, physical activity and sedentary behaviors and basic anthropometric objectively measured indicators (weight, height, waist circumference). The possible mediating effect of sugared drinks intake, breakfast consumption, active transportation to school, sports participation, TV viewing, computer use and sleep duration in the association between parental education and children’s body composition was explored via MacKinnon’s product-of-coefficients test in single and multiple mediation models. Two different body composition indicators were included in the models, namely Body Mass Index and waist circumference. Results: The association between parental education and children’s body composition was partially mediated by breakfast consumption, sports participation, TV viewing and computer use. Additionally, a suppression effect was found for sugared drinks intake. No mediation effect was found for active transportation and sleep duration. The significant mediators explained a higher proportion of the association between parental education and waist circumference compared to the association between parental education and BMI. Conclusions: Tailored overweight and obesity prevention strategies in low SES preadolescent populations should incorporate specific messages focusing on the importance of encouraging daily breakfast consumption, increasing sports participation and decreasing TV viewing and computer use. However, longitudinal research to support these findings is needed.

The integration of persuasive Web-based features may boost engagement and therefore weight loss. Objective: To determine whether an 8-week challenge within a commercial Web-based weight loss program influenced weight loss, website use, and attrition in the short term, when compared to the standard program. Methods: De-identified data for participants (mean age 36.7 ± 10.3 years; 86% female) who enrolled in the Biggest Loser Club (BLC) (n = 952) and the BLC’s Shannan Ponton Fast Track Challenge (SC) for 8 weeks (n = 381) were compared. The BLC program used standard evidence-based website features, with individualized calorie and exercise targets to facilitate a weight loss of 0.5-1 kg per week (−500 kcal/day less than estimated energy expenditure). SC used the same website features but in addition promoted greater initial weight loss using a 1200 kcal/day energy intake target and physical activity energy expenditure of 600 kcal/day. SC used persuasive features to facilitate greater user engagement, including offering additional opportunities for social support (eg, webinar meetings with a celebrity personal trainer and social networking) endorsed by a celebrity personal trainer. Self-reported weekly weight records were used to determine weight change after 8 weeks. A primary analysis was undertaken using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with all available weight records for all participants included. Dropout (participants who cancelled their subscription) and nonusage (participants who stopped using the Web-based features) attrition rates at 8 weeks were calculated. The number of participants who accessed each website feature and the total number of days each feature was used were calculated. The difference between attrition rates and website use for the two programs were tested using chi-square and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests, respectively. Results: Using GLMM, including weight data for all participants, there was significantly greater ( P = .03) 8-week weight loss in SC (−5.1 kg [−5.5 to −4.6 kg] or −6.0%) compared to BLC participants (−4.5 kg [−4.8, −4.2] or −5.0%). Dropout rates were low and consistent across groups (BLC: 17 (1.8%) vs SC: 2 (0.5%), P = .08) and 48.7% (456/936) of BLC and 51.2% (184/379) of SC participants accessed the website at 8 weeks, with no difference between programs ( P = .48). SC participants accessed the discussion forums, menu plans, exercise plans, and educational materials significantly more than BLC participants ( P < .05). Conclusions: Using a short-term challenge with persuasive features, including online social support with endorsement by a celebrity personal trainer, as well as a greater energy balance deficit, within a commercial Web-based weight loss program may facilitate greater initial weight loss and engagement with some program components. The results support the need for a more rigorous and prospective evaluation of Web-based weight loss programs that incorporate additional strategies to enhance initial weight loss and engagement, such as a short-term challenge.

A prototype web-based simulation named  Stormview is described that allows individuals to experience the approach of a hurricane in a computer-based environment. In Stormview participants can gather storm information through various media, hear the opinions of neighbors, and indicate intentions to take protective action. We illustrate how the ability to exert experimental control over the information viewed by participants can be used to provide insights into decision making that would be difficult to gain from field studies, such as how preparedness decisions are affected by the nature of news coverage of prior storms, how a storm’s movement is depicted in graphics, and the content of word-of-mouth communications. Data from an initial application involving a sample of Florida residents reveal a number of unexpected findings about hurricane risk response. Participants who viewed forecast graphics, which contained track lines depicting the most likely path of the storm, for example, had higher levels of preparation than those who saw graphics that showed only uncertainty cones—even among those living far from the predicted center path. Similarly, the participants who were most likely to express worry about an approaching storm and fastest to undertake preparatory action were those who, ironically, had never experienced one. Finally, external validity is evidenced by a close rank-order correspondence between patterns of information use revealed in the lab and that found in previous cross-sectional field studies.

Nonadherence (ie, participants not following the intervention protocol) is an issue. By studying the way Web-based interventions are used and whether there are differences between adherers (ie, participants that started all 9 lessons) and nonadherers, more insight can be gained into the process of adherence. Objective: The aims of this study were to (1) describe the characteristics of participants and investigate their relationship with adherence, (2) investigate the utilization of the different features of the intervention and possible differences between adherers and nonadherers, and (3) identify what use patterns emerge and whether there are differences between adherers and nonadherers. Methods: Data were used from 206 participants that used the Web-based intervention Living to the full, a Web-based intervention for the prevention of depression employing both a fully automated and human-supported format. Demographic and baseline characteristics of participants were collected by using an online survey. Log data were collected within the Web-based intervention itself. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed. Results: In all, 118 participants fully adhered to the intervention (ie, started all 9 lessons). Participants with an ethnicity other than Dutch were more often adherers (χ²undefined = 5.5,  P = .02), and nonadherers used the Internet more hours per day on average (F1,203 = 3.918, P = .049). A logistic regression showed that being female (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.01-4.04; P = .046) and having a higher need for cognition (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.00-1.05; P = .02) increased the odds of adhering to the intervention. Overall, participants logged in an average of 4 times per lesson, but adherers logged in significantly more times per lesson than nonadherers ( F 1,204 = 20.710; P < .001). For use patterns, we saw that early nonadherers seemed to use fewer sessions and spend less time than late nonadherers and adherers, and fewer sessions to complete the lesson than adherers. Furthermore, late nonadherers seemed to have a shorter total duration of sessions than adherers. Conclusions: By using log data combined with baseline characteristics of participants, we extracted valuable lessons for redesign of this intervention and the design of Web-based interventions in general. First, although characteristics of respondents can significantly predict adherence, their predictive value is small. Second, it is important to design Web-based interventions to foster adherence and usage of all features in an intervention.

The influence of the home physical environment on children’s physical activity and sedentary behaviour","The International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1449313919?accountid=14026","The home environment is an important influence on the sedentary behaviour and physical activity of children, who have limited independent mobility and spend much of their time at home. This article reviews the current evidence regarding the influence of the home physical environment on the sedentary behaviour and physical activity of children aged 8–14 years. A literature search of peer reviewed articles published between 2005 and 2011 resulted in 38 observational studies (21 with activity outcomes, 23 with sedentary outcomes) and 11 experimental studies included in the review. The most commonly investigated behavioural outcomes were television watching and moderate to vigorous physical activity. Media equipment in the home and to a lesser extent the bedroom were positively associated with children’s sedentary behaviour. Physical activity equipment and the house and yard were not associated with physical activity, although environmental measures were exclusively self-reported. On the other hand, physical activity equipment was inversely associated with sedentary behaviours in half of studies. Observational studies that investigated the influence of the physical and social environment within the home space, found that the social environment, particularly the role of parents, was important. Experimental studies that changed the home physical environment by introducing a television limiting device successfully decreased television viewing, whereas the influence of introducing an active video game on activity outcomes was inconsistent. Results highlight that the home environment is an important influence on children’s sedentary behaviour and physical activity, about which much is still unknown. While changing or controlling the home physical environment shows promise for reducing screen based sedentary behaviour, further interventions are needed to understand the broader impact of these changes. Future studies should prioritise investigating the influence of the home physical environment, and its interaction with the social environment, on objectively measured sedentary time and home context specific behaviours, ideally including technologies that allow objective measures of the home space.

Increasingly research has focused on associations between walking behaviours and neighbourhood environments including street characteristics such as pavement availability and aesthetics. Nevertheless, objective assessment of street-level data is challenging. This research investigates the reliability of a new street characteristic audit tool designed for use with Google Street View, and assesses levels of agreement between computer-based and on-site auditing. Methods: The Forty Area STudy street VIEW (FASTVIEW) tool, a Google Street View based audit tool, was developed incorporating nine categories of street characteristics. Using the tool, desk-based audits were conducted by trained researchers across one large UK town during 2011. Both inter and intra-rater reliability were assessed. On-site street audits were also completed to test the criterion validity of the method. All reliability scores were assessed by percentage agreement and the kappa statistic. Results: Within-rater agreement was high for each category of street characteristic (range: 66.7%-90.0%) and good to high between raters (range: 51.3%-89.1%). A high level of agreement was found between the Google Street View audits and those conducted in-person across the nine categories examined (range: 75.0%-96.7%). Conclusion: The audit tool was found to provide a reliable and valid measure of street characteristics. The use of Google Street View to capture street characteristic data is recommended as an efficient method that could substantially increase potential for large-scale objective data collection.

Surprisingly, some users choose to share their sleeping patterns, perhaps both for awareness as well as a sense of connection to others. Indeed, sharing basic sleep data, whether a person has gone to bed or waking up, informs others about not just one's sleeping routines but also indicates physical state, and reflects a sense of wellness. We present Somnometer, a social alarm clock for mobile phones that helps users to capture and share their sleep patterns. While the sleep rating is obtained from explicit user input, the sleep duration is estimated based on monitoring a user's interactions with the app. Observing that many individuals currently utilize their mobile phone as an alarm clock revealed behavioral patterns that we were able to leverage when designing the app. We assess whether it is possible to reliably monitor one's sleep duration using such apps. We further investigate whether providing users with the ability to track their sleep behavior over a long time period can empower them to engage in healthier sleep habits. We hypothesize that sharing sleep information with social networks impacts awareness and connectedness among friends. The result from a controlled study reveals that it is feasible to monitor a user's sleep duration based just on her interactions with an alarm clock app on the mobile phone. The results from both an in-the-wild study and a controlled experiment suggest that providing a way for users to track their sleep behaviors increased user awareness of sleep patterns and induced healthier habits. However, we also found that, given the current broadcast nature of existing social networks, users were concerned with sharing their sleep patterns indiscriminately.

Spanish children from rural public schools (10–12 years;  n = 1068) completed a self-report questionnaire which measured being cyberbullied, Internet use and parental mediation strategies. Logistic regression analyses examined the association among cyberbullying victimization, online activities, intensity and purposes of online communication, and restricting, evaluating and co-using parental mediation. The results show that Internet use, specifically online communication, increases the likelihood of cyberbullying victimization. Conversely, monitoring software installed on the computer, joint creation of rules regarding the time spent online and personal information shared help lessen the likelihood of online victimization. The results are examined in the light of previous research, while implications for practice and future research are considered.

Abuse and harmed identity in Fifty Shades of Grey","Journal of Women's Health","","1540-9996, 1540-9996","10.1089/jwh.2013.4344","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1523810709?accountid=14026","Background: While intimate partner violence (IPV) affects 25% of women and impairs health, current societal conditions—including the normalization of abuse in popular culture such as novels, film, and music—create the context to support such violence.  Fifty Shades of Grey, a best-selling novel, depicts a ‘‘romantic’’ and ‘‘erotic’’ relationship involving 28-year-old megamillionaire, Christian Grey, and a 22-year-old college student, Anastasia Steele. We argue that the relationship is characterized by IPV, which is harmful to Anastasia. Methods: All authors engaged in iterative readings of the text, and wrote narrative summaries to elucidate themes. Validity checks included double review of the first eight chapters of the novel to establish consistency in our analysis approach, iterative discussions in-person and electronically to arbitrate discrepancies, and review of our analysis with other abuse and sexual practice experts. To characterize IPV, we used the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s definitions of emotional abuse (intimidation/threats; isolation; stalking; and humiliation) and sexual violence (forced sex acts/contact against a person’s will, including using alcohol/drugs or intimidation/pressure). To characterize harm, we used Smith’s conceptualizations of perceived threat, managing, altered identity, yearning, entrapment, and disempowerment experienced by abused women. Results: Emotional abuse is present in nearly every interaction, including: stalking (Christian deliberately follows Anastasia and appears in unusual places, uses a phone and computer to track Anastasia’s whereabouts, and delivers expensive gifts); intimidation (Christian uses intimidating verbal and nonverbal behaviors, such as routinely commanding Anastasia to eat and threatening to punish her); and isolation (Christian limits Anastasia’s social contact). Sexual violence is pervasive—including using alcohol to compromise Anastasia’s consent, as well as intimidation (Christian initiates sexual encounters when genuinely angry, dismisses Anastasia’s requests for boundaries, and threatens her). Anastasia experiences reactions typical of abused women, including: constant perceived threat (‘‘my stomach churns from his threats’’); altered identity (describes herself as a ‘‘pale, haunted ghost’’); and stressful managing (engages in behaviors to ‘‘keep the peace,’’ such as withholding information about her social whereabouts to avoid Christian’s anger). Anastasia becomes disempowered and entrapped in the relationship as her behaviors become mechanized in response to Christian’s abuse. Conclusions: Our analysis identified patterns in Fifty Shades that reflect pervasive intimate partner violence—one of the biggest problems of our time. Further, our analysis adds to a growing body of literature noting dangerous violence standards being perpetuated in popular culture.

This article, a follow up report on the original survey (Streeter, 2010), examines the effects of respondent gender on attitude in order to identify issues that will need to be taken into account during the next phase of research and development. Results indicate that male music therapists may hold more positive opinions about computer-aided practice evaluation than female music therapists. However, the data also shows that female respondents were more concerned than their male counterparts about the ethical and practical issues that might arise if they were to introduce computer-aided evaluation at work. Both genders expressed excitement at the prospect of a specialist system designed to record, store, and quantify changes in music play between a music therapist and a patient.

To this end, the study outlines the functions of a potential data repository and reviews extant research studies. The review focuses on computer applications that used meaning aids to make the meaning of language items accessible during reading activities. The goal is to identify the required data fields for such repository by taking into account existing research studies. Finally, the study provides two potential research studies to exemplify how researchers can use the aggregated data from the repository to study research questions.

Much of this literature implicitly assumes healthy adults maintain an accurate body image. We recently developed a novel, implicit, and quantitative measure of body image—the Body Image Task (BIT). Here, we report a large-scale analysis of performance on this task by healthy adults. In both an in-person and an online version of the BIT, participants were presented with an image of a head as an anchoring stimulus on a computer screen, and told to imagine that the head was part of a mirror image of themselves in a standing position. They were then instructed to judge where, relative to the head, each of several parts of their body would be located. The relative positions of each landmark can be used to construct an implicit perceptual map of bodily structure. We could thus measure the internally-stored body image, although we cannot exclude contributions from other representations. Our results show several distortions of body image. First, we found a large and systematic over-estimation of width relative to height. These distortions were similar for both males and females, and did not closely track the idiosyncrasies of individual participant's own bodies. Comparisons of individual body parts showed that participants overestimated the width of their shoulders and the length of their upper arms, relative to their height, while underestimating the lengths of their lower arms and legs. Principal components analysis showed a clear spatial structure to the distortions, suggesting spatial organisation and segmentation of the body image into upper and lower limb components that are bilaterally integrated. These results provide new insight into the body image of healthy adults, and have implications for the study and rehabilitation of clinical populations.

In our approach, we use a 2-step process: First we use text replay tagging, a type of rapid protocol analysis in which categories are developed and, in turn, used to hand-score students' log data. In the second step, educational data mining is conducted using a combination of the text replay data and machine-distilled features of student interactions in order to produce an automated means of assessing the inquiry skill in question; this is referred to as a  detector.

This article describes 2 major innovation areas in the learning sciences that apply to simulation and other aspects of medical learning: Perceptual learning (PL) and adaptive learning technologies. PL technology offers, for the first time, systematic, computer-based methods for teaching pattern recognition, structural intuition, transfer, and fluency. Synergistic with PL are new adaptive learning technologies that optimize learning for each individual, embed objective assessment, and implement mastery criteria. The author describes the Adaptive Response-Time-based Sequencing (ARTS) system, which uses each learner's accuracy and speed in interactive learning to guide spacing, sequencing, and mastery. In recent efforts, these new technologies have been applied in medical learning contexts, including adaptive learning modules for initial medical diagnosis and perceptual/adaptive learning modules (PALMs) in dermatology, histology, and radiology. Results of all these efforts indicate the remarkable potential of perceptual and adaptive learning technologies, individually and in combination, to improve learning in a variety of medical domains.

High-achieving students self-reported having the easiest time learning the introductory programming topics. In a quantitative analysis, though, high-achieving and average students were: 1) more effective at debugging (on average, as quantified by Jadud's Error Quotient (EQ)) than low-achieving students; and 2) were least confused, as quantified using Lee's confusion metric. However, the differences in EQ and confusion between groups were not statistically significant. This implied that all groups struggled with programming to similar extents. This finding was further supported by was used to delineate two sets of variables. The results indicate that preference for autonomy in computer science learning positively predicts self-efficacy in learning computer science with the strongest coefficient. Computer science learner preference for teacher control is also a positive predictor. However, preference for participation in managing the computer class and preference for depending on the teacher did not play a significant role in the students' self-efficacy in learning computer science.

Compared to more tractable and constrained learning domains for ITS, writing is an ill-defined domain because the features of effective writing are difficult to quantify and individual writers can employ diverse strategies to achieve similar goals. The development of an ITS in an ill-defined domain presents particular challenges regarding comprehensive instruction, modularized content, extended practice, and formative feedback. In this article, we describe how the development of W-Pal has uniquely addressed these concerns and present the results of a study assessing the feasibility of this system in high school English classrooms. This study included 2 teachers and their 141 10th grade English class students who utilized W-Pal over a 6-month period during the academic year. Log-file analyses showed that students used all aspects of W-Pal, but activity and engagement was uneven throughout the year and decreased over time. Essay scores improved over time and surveys indicated that students perceived the lessons, games, and feedback as beneficial. However, specific aspects of the learning environment were critiqued as annoying, challenging, or lacking specificity. Overall, the results suggest that the system was generally well-received by the students but also offer insights for the development of ITSs in ill-defined domains.

Successful individuals regulate their motivational, cognitive, and metacognitive engagement. Our hypothesis is that successful groups also share in regulating group processes. Following our earlier conceptual and empirical work on the social aspect of motivating and regulating learning (Hadwin & Järvelä, 2011; Järvenoja & Järvelä, 2009; Järvelä, Volet, & Järvenoja, 2010), our research questions are as follows: (a) What challenges do individuals and groups report experiencing during collaborative group work? (b) How do students collectively regulate these challenges at the time, and in future collaborations? (c) How do collaborative learning outcomes compare between groups with varying degrees of emerging shared regulation? We present an empirical study in which 18 graduate students worked in collaborative teams of 3–4 over an 8-week period. The nStudy (Winne, Hadwin, & Beaudoin, 2010) software was used for collaborative planning and work, as well as face-to-face and online collaboration between team members. Data included individual and collaborative statements about collaborative challenges, collaborative statements about contextual and future regulation strategies, collaborative learning performance, and log file traces of students' contributions to collaborative chat discussions and planning activities. Findings indicated that the students expressed multiple challenges resulting in 3 kinds of regulation over time profiles: strong, progressive, and weak shared regulation. We also conclude that successful collaboration not only requires self-regulation but also allows each team member to support fellow team members to successfully regulate their learning and the team to come together to collectively regulate learning.

Text messaging holds promise as a viable self-monitoring modality, particularly among racial/ethnic minority populations. Objective: This pilot study evaluated the feasibility of a text messaging intervention for weight loss among predominantly black women. Methods: Fifty obese women were randomized to either a 6-month intervention using a fully automated system that included daily text messages for self-monitoring tailored behavioral goals (eg, 10,000 steps per day, no sugary drinks) along with brief feedback and tips (n = 26) or to an education control arm (n = 24). Weight was objectively measured at baseline and at 6 months. Adherence was defined as the proportion of text messages received in response to self-monitoring prompts. Results: The average daily text messaging adherence rate was 49% (SD 27.9) with 85% (22/26) texting self-monitored behavioral goals 2 or more days per week. Approximately 70% (16/23) strongly agreed that daily texting was easy and helpful and 76% (16/21) felt the frequency of texting was appropriate. At 6 months, the intervention arm lost a mean of 1.27 kg (SD 6.51), and the control arm gained a mean of 1.14 kg (SD 2.53; mean difference –2.41 kg, 95% CI –5.22 to 0.39;  P = .09). There was a trend toward greater text messaging adherence being associated with greater percent weight loss ( r = –.36; P = .08), but this did not reach statistical significance. There was no significant association between goal attainment and text messaging adherence and no significant predictors of adherence. Conclusions: Given the increasing penetration of mobile devices, text messaging may be a useful self-monitoring tool for weight control, particularly among populations most in need of intervention.

Self-reported informatics competencies were collected from 132 DNP students (68 post-BS and 64 post-MS students) in their first year in the program (2007 to 2010). Students were assessed in 18 areas of 3 competency categories: computer skills, informatics knowledge, and informatics skills. Post-BS students were competent in 4 areas (computer skills in communication, systems, documentation, and informatics knowledge about impact of information management), whereas post-MS students were competent in only 1 area (computer skills in communication). Students in both tracks reported computer skills in decision support as their least competent area. Overall, post-BS students reported slightly higher than or similar competency scores as post-MS students, but scores were statistically significant in only 3 of 18 areas. The assessment indicated that knowledge and skills on informatics competencies need to be improved, especially in computer skills for data access and use of decision support systems. Strategies are suggested to integrate competencies into existing informatics course and DNP curricula. Further studies are recommended using an objective measure of informatics competencies.

Methods: The sample of noninstitutionalized U.S, civilians was selected by a complex, multistage probability design. Data from the 2003-2006 National Health and Examination Survey were used. Two hundred six pregnant women were Included in the data analysis. Physical activity and sedentary data were objectively measured via accelerometry (ActiGraph 7164). Biomarker data was obtained in the mobile examination center from urine, blood samples, blood pressure, and anthropometric measurements. Urine and blood samples were obtained to determine pregnancy status, C-reactive protein (CRP), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and cotinine as well as fasting glucose, fasting triglycerides, and fasting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol data. Multivariable regression was employed to examine the association between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and biomarker levels. Results: There was a positive association between sedentary behavior and CRP levels (beta coefficient [ b] = 0.001, p = 0.02) and LDL cholesterol ( b = 0.12, p = 0.02). There was an inverse association between light-intensity physical activity and CRP ( b = -0.003; p = 0.008) and diastolic blood pressure ( b = -0.03; p = 0.02), with those engaging in higher levels of MVPA having higher HDL cholesterol ( b = 6.7; p = 0,01). Conclusion: Physical activity and sedentary behavior were favorably associated with various biomarkers among pregnant women, suggesting that healthcare providers should encourage pregnant women to participate in safe forms of physical activity behaviors while also reducing their amount of time spent in sedentary behaviors.

In addition, technologies supporting asynchronous communication outside of clinical encounters, such as email, SMS, and patient portals, are being increasingly used for follow-up, education, and data reporting. Meanwhile, patients are increasingly adopting personal tools to track various aspects of health status and therapeutic progress, wishing to review these data with clinicians during consultations. These issues have drawn increasing interest from the human–computer interaction (HCI) community, with special focus on critical challenges in patient-centered interactions and design opportunities that can address these challenges. We saw this community presenting and interacting at the ACM SIGCHI 2013, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (also known as CHI), held April 27–May 2nd, 2013 at the Palais de Congrès de Paris in France. CHI 2013 featured many formal avenues to pursue patient-centered health communication: a well-attended workshop, tracks of original research, and a lively panel discussion. In this report, we highlight these events and the main themes we identified. We hope that it will help bring the health care communication and the HCI communities closer together.

For electronic gaming machines (EGMs), house edge is the hold percentage. The paper tracks changes in hold percentage for club and hotel EGM gambling in Australia. We use real gambling turnover and revenue data to show that hold generally falls over time, save for the State of Victoria between 1993 and 2009. In Victoria, hold fell during the roll-out phase of the sector, before rising steadily. We examine local level data, finding that hold varied considerably by gaming operator across the period, before converging. The unique owner/operator corporate duopoly that existed in Victoria is posed as a potential explanation for aggregate price changes. We then calculate estimates of the monetary value of changes in hold percentage. We find increased hold can lead to substantial monetary redistributions of gamblers' stakes toward the house and away from gamblers. Policy options to protect gamblers from the unfairness of undetectable price rises are discussed, including the possibility of a more tightly regulated hold percentage, a tax on windfall profits derived from raising hold, and tying game identities to particular hold percentages.

"J6M35VPI","journalArticle","2013","Schurger, Aaron; Marti, Sebastien; Dehaene, Stanislas","Reducing multi-sensor data to a single time course that reveals experimental effects","BMC Neuroscience","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1821808169?accountid=14026","Background: Multi-sensor technologies such as EEG, MEG, and ECoG result in high-dimensional data sets. Given the high temporal resolution of such techniques, scientific questions very often focus on the time-course of an experimental effect. In many studies, researchers focus on a single sensor or the average over a subset of sensors covering a “region of interest” (ROI). However, single-sensor or ROI analyses ignore the fact that the spatial focus of activity is constantly changing, and fail to make full use of the information distributed over the sensor array. Methods: We describe a technique that exploits the optimality and simplicity of matched spatial filters in order to reduce experimental effects in multivariate time series data to a single time course. Each (multi-sensor) time sample of each trial is replaced with its projection onto a spatial filter that is matched to an observed experimental effect, estimated from the remaining trials (Effect-Matched Spatial filtering, or EMS filtering). The resulting set of time courses (one per trial) can be used to reveal the temporal evolution of an experimental effect, which distinguishes this approach from techniques that reveal the temporal evolution of an anatomical source or region of interest. Results: We illustrate the technique with data from a dual-task experiment and use it to track the temporal evolution of brain activity during the psychological refractory period. We demonstrate its effectiveness in separating the means of two experimental conditions, and in significantly improving the signal-to-noise ratio at the single-trial level. It is fast to compute and results in readily-interpretable time courses and topographies. The technique can be applied to any data-analysis question that can be posed independently at each sensor, and we provide one example, using linear regression, that highlights the versatility of the technique. Conclusion: The approach described here combines established techniques in a way that strikes a balance between power, simplicity, speed of processing, and interpretability. We have used it to provide a direct view of parallel and serial processes in the human brain that previously could only be measured indirectly. An implementation of the technique in MatLab is freely available via the internet.

The aim of this study was to describe longitudinal patterns of ownership and examine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of bedroom media with children’s sedentary behaviour. Methods: Data are from the Sport, Physical activity and Eating behaviour: Environmental Determinants in Young people (SPEEDY) study, collected at 3 time-points: baseline (2007, T₀; age 10.3 ± 0.3 years), 1-year (T 1y) and 4-year (T 4y) follow-up. For each assessment, 1512 (44.9% male), 715 (41.0% male), and 319 (48.3% male) participants provided valid accelerometer data. Outcome variables were accelerometer-assessed sedentary time and self-reported screen-time. The presence of a television or computer in the bedroom was self-reported by participants and a combined bedroom media score calculated as the sum of such items. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between bedroom media and each outcome were examined using multi-level linear regression. Results: Bedroom TV ownership fell from 70.9% at T₀ to 42.5% at T 4y. Having a TV in the bedroom (beta; 95% CI*100, T₀: -1.17; -1.88, -0.46. T 1y: -1.68; -2.67, -0.70) and combined bedroom media (T₀: -0.76; -1.26, -0.27. T 1y: -0.79; -1.51, -0.07) were negatively associated with objectively measured weekly sedentary time at T₀ and T 1y. Having a computer in the bedroom (beta; 95% CI, T₀: 0.15; 0.02, 0.29. T 4y: 0.35; 0.10, 0.60) and combined bedroom media (T₀: 0.09: 0.01, 0.18. T 4y: 0.20; 0.05, 0.34) were positively associated with screen-time at T0 and T4y. Relative to participants without a computer throughout the study, children that had a computer in their bedroom at T₀ but not at T 4y (beta; 95% CI for change in screen-time: -8.02; -12.75, -3.29) reported smaller increases in screen-time. Conclusions: The bedroom media environment changes with age and exhibits a complex relationship with children’s sedentary behaviour. Modifying children’s bedroom media environment may impact upon screen-time but appears unlikely to influence overall sedentary time.

The merging was achieved online with high spatial and temporal resolution, using data gloves and a wireless network. This data set was used to generate information cartographies of visitors, visualizing their spatial behavior and physiological responses in the environment. In a field study with 576 museum visitors, the methodology was successfully implemented. Significant associations between physiology and aesthetic evaluations supported the validity of the cartographic representations; participants reported little reactivity toward the technical equipment.

"WLM9IACX","thesis","2014","Padilla, Sandra","Professional development in southwestern community colleges and the utilization of engaged practices for effective teaching and learning in the developmental reading classroom","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1499093755?accountid=14026","Reading is the most critical skill determining college success. Yet, only 48% of students enrolled in developmental reading courses actually complete the required track. Critical examination in developmental education suggests that students do not complete developmental courses at the community college level due to the idea that the curriculum is lacking in culturally responsive pedagogical tools and strategies. Student retention can best be accomplished by a change in pedagogical style that supports a more engaged interaction in the classroom. Thus, it is critical for college leaders to provide more efficient professional development opportunities to assist educators in meeting the needs of the developmental reading student. The investigation used descriptive statistics to measure frequencies and percentages to determine how southwestern region two-year public community colleges utilize professional development with reading faculty to encourage the use of engaged practices in the developmental reading classroom. Respondents were asked to complete a survey developed by the researcher. The study examined developmental reading faculty's understanding of engaged practices and the types of engaged practices they employ in the classroom. Data revealed that most developmental reading faculty understand the connection between engaged learning and active learning. Faculty are employing traditional forms of engaged learning, such as in-class debates, peer assisted activities, and the Internet. However, nontraditional forms of engaged practices, such as games, Socratic seminars and Clickers are less frequently employed. The study also examined faculty development needs for professional development utilizing engaged practices in the developmental reading classroom. The results of the study indicated that while developmental reading faculty are comfortable with their abilities/skills and preparedness in teaching developmental reading courses that integrate engaged practices, they do acknowledge a need for more follow-up activities, trainings, mentoring, and course design focused on engaged practices. A final point of examination was the extent to which southwestern two-year public community colleges presently offer faculty development utilizing engaged practices for developmental reading instructors. The results indicated that while institutions are providing professional development focused on engaged practices, developmental reading faculty would like to participate in additional training, orientations sessions, mentoring, and course design development opportunities integrating engaged practices.

Methods: Congregation members (n=155; Caucasian (n= 143, 92%); female (n=96, 62%); mean age 43 ± 13.5 years), completed a one-time online questionnaire on spirituality (SWB), current health status and CC usage. Individuals ≥40 years (Caucasian; female (n=18, 69%), mean age 54 ± 6.3 years) completed additional assessments on PA, social support, self-efficacy at baseline (Base-PAQ: n=26) and 6 months (6mos-PAQ: n=18), and participated in focus groups (n=6). Results: 102/155 (66%) of respondents participated in the CC, with the track reported as the most desirable component of the CC in the cross-sectional study (57/ 102). The track also was favored (14/21) at the baseline physical activity questionnaire (Base-PAQ), while trails were favored (8/14) at the six month follow-up (6mos-PAQ). Spirituality levels of both samples were in the mid-ranges. Age, sex and CC participation were not related to spirituality. However, higher levels of education were related to higher spirituality scores at baseline. Better health status, better mental health, and higher levels of life satisfaction were related to increased CC participation in the cross sectional study. A majority (133/155) of those who were physically active were CC participants and reported higher duration of moderate PA and higher frequency of both moderate and vigorous PA. In addition, participants who were trying to lose weight were more likely to use the CC at baseline. The more often individuals used the CC, the more physically active they were at both Base-PAQ (significant) and 6mos-PAQ (approached significance). They also were more likely to participate in moderate and vigorous activity for longer duration at Base-PAQ and participate in vigorous PA more often at 6mos-PAQ. Neither social support nor self-efficacy predicted PA or CC participation at Base-PAQ or 6mos-PAQ. Based on qualitative results, PA barriers included environment, time, lack of motivation, priorities and physical health, while the primary motivator mentioned was health-related benefits. Personal networks and relationships already established at the CC gave participants more of a personal experience and encouraged them to be more active as well. Conclusion: Results suggest that a faith-based facility has the potential to increase PA among its participants. However, further research with larger sample sizes and more diverse populations is needed.

The research problem that this study addressed is that the majority of schools are not on track to demonstrate this proficiency, potentially creating a nation of schools designated as ""failing."" This problem has underscored the importance of new and innovative approaches, both during and after school. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a particular approach, a computer-based afterschool intervention program designed, to deliver differentiated instruction to low-performing students. The research questions for this study concerned the effectiveness of this treatment in improving overall and reading comprehension scores on English district benchmark exams. The theoretical foundation for this study was Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, according to which students learn best when they receive individualized instruction delivered at their academic level. This quasi-experimental study used a regression discontinuity design because it allowed for assigning those students who needed the treatment the most while yielding valid results. Linear regression was used to test for a discontinuity in the regression lines on either side of a predetermined cutoff value, the value that determined whether or not the participants were in the treatment or comparison groups. The discontinuity that was found represented a statistically significant treatment effect and supported the notion that delivering instruction in a student's zone of proximal development improves comprehension and overall academic performance. These results give teachers, administrators, and policymakers a research-backed strategy to address the achievement gap that still exists between urban and suburban schools, specifically in the area of reading comprehension.

Previous research, interviews with educators, a focus group, an expert review, and a think aloud protocol were used to design a survey instrument. After finalization, the survey was made available to a group of educators for trial on the Internet. The data from the trial survey was then analyzed. A portion of the survey required respondents to rate to what degree 32 potential barriers were perceived as an impediment to the adoption of games and simulations into their curriculum. The highest rated barriers included: cost of equipment, lack of time to plan and implement, inability to try before purchase, lack of balance between entertainment and education, lack of available lesson plans/examples, lack of alignment to state standards/standardized testing, inability to customize a game/simulation, and inability to track student progress within the game/simulation. An exploratory factor analysis identified seven factors that accounted for 67% of the variability in the respondents’ rankings. These seven factors were: Issues with Negative Potential Student Outcomes, Technology Issues, Issues Specific to Games and Simulations, Teacher Issues, Issues with Games and Simulations in Education, Incorporation Difficulties, and Student Ability. Interestingly, by using a MANOVA and follow-up ANOVA, several factors were found to have significant interactions with other questions on the survey. For instance, male educators ranked items in the Issues with Negative Potential Student Outcomes category as more of a barrier than female educators. Another gender difference was the ranking of items in the Technology Issues and the Teacher Issues categories; female educators ranked these items as more of a barrier than their male counterparts. Another significant interaction occurred between the Technology Issues category and Respondent Game Play Frequency. Those respondents that did not play games very frequently ranked individual technology barriers higher than those respondents who were more experienced with game playing. Implications of these, and other results, as well as recommendations for further research and for game and simulation implementation for educators and administrators, are discussed.

Studies have shown that consumers trust their social networks and consider them more credible than advertisers and other media sources; therefore, WOM is immeasurably valuable to marketing. Historically, measuring the effects of WOM has been difficult since most has taken place within private social networks. The Internet and social media have now given marketers an opportunity to track and record the newest and possibly most influential form of WOM – electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM). This is especially important because, with the Internet, consumers can potentially reach and influence peers on a global scale, making the power eWOM exponentially greater than traditional WOM. Despite its prevalence in the popular press, relatively little empirical research has been done in eWOM, creating a rare case where academia is playing catch-up with practitioners. Accordingly, this study used the conceptual framework of relationship marketing to test several associated hypotheses. Linear regression analysis was employed to measure the impact of eWOM on the sales success of experience goods, specifically, Amazon Kindle books. Results from data (collected daily for twelve weeks) indicated that two eWOM variables have a consistent, positive impact on sales: 1) the number of customer reviews, and 2) the number of Amazon ""likes."" The average customer rating was significant four of the twelve weeks but only at a 90% confidence interval level. One additional eWOM variable, the number of Twitter Followers an author has, significantly impacted sales, but only during the five weeks surrounding the Christmas holiday; perhaps evidence of a ""Social Media Holiday Effect."" Interestingly, in the instances where the number of Facebook friends an author has was statistically significant, it showed a significantly negative effect on sales. No evidence was found to support a relationship between sales success and the average author rating, the average similar products rating, the category, or the publisher type.

"86R4VTSZ","thesis","2014","Johnson, Garrett","Essays on the economics of online display advertising","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1511553376?accountid=14026","Chapter 1 examines the impact of privacy policy on the auction market for online display advertising. The advent of online advertising has simultaneously created unprecedented opportunities for advertisers to target consumers and prompted privacy concerns among consumers and regulators. This paper estimates the financial impact of privacy policies on the online display ad industry by applying an empirical model to a proprietary auction dataset. Two challenges complicate the analysis. First, while the advertisers are assumed to publicly observe tracking profiles, the econometrician does not see this data. My model overcomes this challenge by disentangling the unobserved premium paid for certain users from the observed bids. In order to simulate a market in which advertisers can no longer track users, I set the unobserved bid premium's variance to zero. Second, the data provider uses a novel auction mechanism in which first-price bidders and second-price bidders operate concurrently. I develop new techniques to analyze these hybrid auctions. I consider three privacy policies that vary by the degree of user choice. My results suggest that online publisher revenues drop by 3.9% under an opt-out policy, 34.6% under an opt-in policy, and 38.5% under a tracking ban. Total advertiser surplus drops by 4.6%, 40.9%, and 45.5% respectively. Chapter 2 measures the effectiveness of online display advertising using a large-scale field experiment. Yahoo! Research partnered with a nationwide retailer to study the effectiveness of display advertising on online and in-store sales for more than three million shared customers. We measure the impact of higher ad impression frequency using a simple experimental design on Yahoo!: users in the `Full' treatment group see the retailer's ads, users in the `Control' group see unrelated control ads, and users in the `Half' treatment group see an equal probability mixture of the retailer and control ads. We find statistically significant evidence that the retailer ads increase sales 3.6% in the Full group relative to the control group. Doubling the average number of impressions per person, from 17 to 34 in a two-week period, nearly doubled the treatment effect. Leveraging our experimental design, we find that the returns to ad frequency are approximately linear among those who were eligible to see up to 50 ads and the marginal return to an additional ad exposure is 4?. We also find evidence that the ads had a stronger effect on customers who live closest to the retailer's brick-and-mortar locations, customers who purchased recently, loyal customers, and wealthy customers.

Pre and post-survey data, student interviews, audio and video recordings of classroom sessions, and participation log data were collected and analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. Constructs measured included self-efficacy in mathematics and computers, triggered and maintained interest, future pursuits, and engagement. Survey constructs were verified using factor analysis procedures, and t-tests and effect sizes were calculated for pre and post-survey differences of means. Further analysis using ANCOVA and mixed ANOVA procedures examined constructs and sub-populations flagged as potentially having statistically significant differences of means. No statistically significant differences were found between pre and post-survey means for any construct or population of students. Students reported high self-efficacy and interest in both mathematics and computer use overall on both surveys. Analysis of interview and observation data found evidence of students' interest states shifting from triggered to maintained situational interest during the course of unit implementation. Students with repeated exposure to the Simulations in Statistics units were more likely to show evidence of transitioning interest states. Analysis of participation logs showed that, on average, students were highly engaged throughout the units. Engagement rates did not differ by gender, but the nature of engagement did. Female students engaged in more collaborative behavior, while male students engaged in more independent work and off-task behaviors. Two teachers simultaneously implemented the units in two separate computer labs. The learning environments in these two labs were different: one emphasized collaborative work and student self-directed use of online wiki and tutorial resources; the other teacher did not. In the collaborative focused lab, a larger percentage of behavior was on-task for all students, especially female students. The learning environment was critical to the engagement of female students. Latino/a students reported lower self-efficacy beliefs than white students especially in mathematics. Participation in these units gave students the opportunity to develop new self-efficacy beliefs in math and computer use in this context. These findings inform research efforts to increase interest and motivation for women and people of color to pursue STEM related careers.

In the original article, due to an unfortunate error, the names of all authors have not been published correctly. The Family name and First name have been inverted. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2013-04537-001). Over the past few years multiple studies have attempted to uncover molecular signatures of memory reconsolidation when compared to consolidation. In the present study we used immunocytochemical detection of the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway, to track activated neuronal circuits in the hippocampus and amygdala recruited during the consolidation and reconsolidation of a contextual fear conditioning (CFC) memory. We report selective differences in magnitude and temporal dynamics of activated ERK1/2 signalling in different subregions of these two structures between the post-training and post-retrieval periods, except in the dentate gyrus, where the patterns of activation were similar. We then focused on this brain area to dissect out the patterns of downstream ERK1/2 signalling components, including the phosphorylation of MSK-1 and histone H3 on ser10, along with the induction of the Immediate Early Genes (IEGs) Arc/Arg3.1, c-Fos and Zif268/Egr1 following CFC training and retrieval. We found that the completion of the nucleosomal response as well as the induction of IEGs shorter during the reconsolidation period as compared to consolidation. Our results shed new light on the cellular mechanisms underlying the consolidation and reconsolidation processes engaged following CFC training and retrieval and further extend the notion that memory reconsolidation is not mechanistically a repetition of consolidation. In addition, we provide evidence that the strength of a previously established CFC memory is characterized by distinct patterns of ERK1/2 activation in different hippocampal and amygdalar subfields upon CFC memory recall. Our results emphasize the differences between consolidation and reconsolidation processes in relation to contextual fear memories.

Three research questions are addressed: (1) whether the web-based instruction facilitates students' learning of Chinese expressions of gratitude, (2) whether the effects of instruction vary across proficiency levels, and (3) how L2 learners regard the use of the website as a learning tool. Based on the noticing hypothesis and the pragmatic consciousness-raising approach, a pragmatics website was developed that provided explicit instruction on how to appropriately express gratitude in Chinese and offered awareness-raising exercises and activities for practice. It was structured in eight instructional units and two review sessions. To address the three research questions, this study adopted a pretest-posttest design to include two groups of learners who differed in their proficiency in the Chinese language. The two groups of learners received pragmatics instruction delivered via the self-access website over five weeks. Two weeks prior to the instruction, all learners were asked to complete (1) the language contact profile (LCP) for eliciting their demographic information and their contact with Chinese outside the classroom, (2) a local standardized Chinese proficiency test (CPT) for assessing their proficiency in Chinese, (3) discourse completion tasks/tests (DCT) for soliciting their production of Chinese expressions of gratitude, (4) metapragmatic assessment tasks (MAT) for eliciting their metapragmatic assessment of thanking responses provided, and (5) retrospective interviews for soliciting learners' explanations of their assessments in the MAT. On a weekly basis during the treatment period, learners wrote reflective e-journals in response to prompt questions provided by the researcher, which helped track learners' self-access study progress and their on-going perceptions of the website. One week after the online instruction, all learners were also asked to complete the same types of questionnaires (i.e., the DCT and the MAT) and retrospective interviews for assessing their pragmatic development. Results showed that after receiving the web-based instruction, all learners produced more appropriate expressions of gratitude and used more varied thanking strategies in their responses, regardless of their proficiency. Learners' assessments of Chinese expressions of gratitude became more target-like and their metapragmatic awareness was also promoted. However, higher-level learners seemed to have benefited more from the instruction in their production of Chinese expressions of gratitude than lower-level participants, and the higher-level group demonstrated an overall higher level of pragmatic awareness than the lower-level group after the online instruction. But no significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of learners' metapragmatic assessments. In addition, participants responded positively to the website and put forward constructive suggestions to improve it. Finally, this study interpreted the findings based on cognitive processing theories, proposed both theoretical and pedagogical implications, and discussed the limitations of this study and directions for future research.

Data were collected as part of randomized clinical trials for women diagnosed with breast cancer within the last two months. Expression and reception of emotional support was assessed by tracking and coding the 18,064 messages that 236 patients posted and read in CMSS groups. The final data used in the analysis was created by merging (a) computer-aided content analysis of discussion posts, (b) action log data analysis of system usage, and (c) baseline and 6-month surveys collected to assess change. Results of this study demonstrate that emotional communication competence moderates the effects of expression and reception of emotional support on psychological quality of life and breast cancer-related concerns in both desired and undesired ways. Giving and receiving emotional support in CMSS groups has positive effects on emotional well-being for breast cancer patients with higher emotional communication, while the same exchanges have detrimental impacts on emotional well-being for those with lower emotional communication competence. The theoretical and practical implications for future research are discussed.

These Internet businesses are allowed to use and share their customers' information, with minimal regulatory intervention other than in health and financial areas. This allows companies to create their own data protection and privacy policies. As consumers consent to these Terms of Service and Privacy Agreements, they should understand how their information is being used. But to what extent are consumers really aware? This study explores the awareness, trust and attitudes of consumers in allowing companies to collect and track their personal information. The research is grounded in quantitative methodology while using and applying survey and data analysis techniques to better understand consumer perspectives about the use of their information. The outcome of this research concludes that consumers have concerns over the use of their personal information, and the study indicates that consumers believe a trade-off of their privacy is not a fair exchange for the use of Internet products and services.

Much has been studied revealing the importance of communities of practice to organizations, project success, and knowledge management and some of these same successes hold true for virtual communities of practice. Study participants were 75 Education and Public Outreach community members of NASA's Science Mission Directorate Earth Forum. In this mixed methods study, online workspace metrics were used to track participation and a survey completed by 21 members was used to quantify participation. For a more detailed analysis, 15 community members (5 highly active users, 5 average users, and 5 infrequent users) selected based on survey responses, were interviewed. Finally, survey data was gathered from 7 online facilitators to understand their role in the community. Data collected from these 21 community members and 5 facilitating members suggest that highly active users (logging into the workspace daily), were more likely to have transformative experiences, co-create knowledge, feel ownership of community knowledge, have extended opportunities for community exchange, and find new forms of evaluation. Average users shared some similar characteristics with both the highly active members and infrequent users, representing a group in transition as they become more engaged and active in the online workspace. Inactive users viewed the workspace as having little value, being difficult to navigate, being mainly for gaining basic information about events and community news, and as another demand on their time. Results show the online workspace component of the Earth Science Education and Outreach Forum is playing an important and emerging role for this community by supporting knowledge building and knowledge sharing, and growing in value for those that utilizing it more frequently. The evidence suggests that with increased participation or ""usage"" comes increased value to the participant and the organization. This research illustrates the possible change in mindset held by participating community members when it comes to the nature of co-location. Additionally, it may be of particular importance in exploring changes in the community members' feelings of connection and belonging.

The social web is a collection of social networking sites used by an individual to connect with his or her broader social group. What differentiates the social web from its predecessor web-based community sites, such as newsgroups and discussion forums, is that participants interact in the open, in front of not only their intended audience but their unintended audience as well. The web-based activity of a community of endurance athletes was observed over a three-month period during the spring 2012 marathon season. Twenty-one athletes spread out across six time zones participated in the study. A connective ethnographical method was used to track the activity of the participants as they interacted on Twitter, Facebook, Dailymile, blog, and podcasting sites. Screen capturing software was used to collect data. Follow-up questions were handled via email, Instant Messenger, and Twitter Direct Message. Filed notes were also compiled. Data was coded by hand and consisted of identifying key words/phrases used by the participants in order to identify prevalent themes. Using this method, 818 tweets, 65 blog posts, 5 podcasts, 54 Facebook updates, and 20 Dailymile updates were collected and coded. The outcome was a thick description of community activity. Several discoveries were made as a result: Despite being in front of multiple audiences, individuals will display a primary persona on the social web. Communication practices demonstrated the interplay required between human and non-human factors needed to develop and maintain online communities. Patterns of participation indicate how far the Internet has become ingrained in our lives.

Because walking is commonly utilized in worksite wellness programs (WWP) and self-efficacy is a strong predictor of exercise adherence, the purpose of this study is to determine the value of incorporating the self-efficacy theory with technology to increase and sustain walking for exercise behavior in a healthcare worksite population. This study, consisting of two parts, seeks to answer the following research questions: Will messages based upon the self-efficacy theory delivered during a 1-mile walk significantly increase beliefs around walking for exercise? Will a smartphone application plus self-efficacy messages delivered via text message increase self-efficacy beliefs as well as sustain walking behavior? Do self-efficacy beliefs associated with walking transfer to other forms of physical activity? A pilot study consisting of a one-group, mixed methods, pre-post test nonexperimental design ( N=16) tested the delivery of self-efficacy messages as well as a tool to measure walking self-efficacy beliefs. These beliefs were measured before and after a 1-mile walking session during which verbal self-efficacy messages were delivered. Paired t-test analysis confirmed that self-efficacy beliefs significantly improved. The sustainability study, a two-group randomized control true experimental design, incorporated smartphone technology for tracking walking behavior over 6 weeks and delivery of text messages ( N=73). Both groups used a smartphone application to track their walks and the intervention group received weekly text messages based upon the self-efficacy theory. Self-efficacy beliefs increased significantly within each group, but there was not a significant difference between groups at posttest, which means that the smartphone application and monitoring of behavior may have increased beliefs, but the text messages did not have a significant effect. There was value in the text messages for behavior change as the intervention group sustained the walking behavior one week longer than the control group. While this study design is a novel approach to improving the walking for exercise behavior of worksite population, it should not be used as a sole intervention and instead be combined with other modalities to create a multifaceted WWP.

In recent years conventional mobile phones with a physical keypad are increasingly being replaced by smartphones with a touch screen. The operation of a touch screen phone ironically cannot be done purely ‘by touch’ due to the lack of tactile feedback, and instead requires fixations on a relatively small screen. The question therefore can be asked whether the operation of touch screen telephones deteriorates cycling behaviour more than operation of a conventional mobile phone. Twenty-four participants completed a track on their own bicycle while sending a text message from a conventional and a touch screen mobile phone. In addition the effects of other common activities that can accompany bicycling were studied, including texting at the same time as listening to music, talking on a mobile phone or cycling next to someone and speaking with this companion, and playing a game on a touch screen phone while bicycling. The impacts of all the above conditions on cycling performance and visual detection performance were compared with control conditions in which participants cycled with either one or two hands on the handlebars and were not required to perform any secondary tasks. Bicycle speed was reduced in all telephone conditions and in the condition when cycling next to someone. Lateral position variation increased in all telephone conditions. Use of the touch screen led to a more central position in the cycle lane and resulted in worse visual detection performance compared with the operation of a conventional mobile phone. The main effect of listening to music was that an auditory signal to stop cycling was missed by 83% of the participants. In conclusion, while all investigated types of phone deteriorated cycling performance, the use of a touch phone has a larger negative effect on cycling performance than a conventional mobile phone. With touch screen smartphones taking the place of conventional mobile phones and being used for other purposes than verbal communication, these effects on cycling performance pose a threat to traffic safety.

The rise of Public Health 2.0 requires professional acknowledgment that a new and substantive forum of public discourse about public health exists on social media, such as forums, blogs, Facebook, and Twitter. Objective: Some public health professionals have used social media in innovative ways: to surveil populations, gauge public opinion, disseminate health information, and promote mutually beneficial interactions between public health professionals and the lay public. Although innovation is on the rise, most in the public health establishment remain skeptical of this rapidly evolving landscape or are unclear about how it could be used. We sought to evaluate the extent to which public health professionals are engaged in these spaces. Methods: We conducted a survey of professorial- and scientist-track faculty at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. We asked all available faculty via email to complete a 30-question survey about respondent characteristics, beliefs about social media, and usage of specific technologies, including blogs, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Results: A total of 181 (19.8%) of 912 professor- and scientist-track faculty provided usable responses. The majority of respondents rarely used major social media platforms. Of these 181 respondents, 97 (53.6%) had used YouTube, 84 (46.4%) had used Facebook, 55 (30.4%) had read blogs, and 12 (6.6%) had used Twitter in the prior month. More recent degree completion was the best predictor of higher usage of social media. In all, 122 (67.4%) agreed that social media is important for disseminating information, whereas only 55 (30.4%) agreed that social media is useful for their research. In all, 43 (23.8%) said social media was helpful for professional career advancement, whereas 72 (39.8%) said it was not. Only 43 (23.8%) faculty said they would employ a full-or part-time social media consultant, and 30 (16.6%) currently employed one. Conclusions: Despite near-universal appreciation of the potential for social media to serve as a component of public health strategy, a small minority are actually engaged in this space professionally, whereas most are either disinterested or actively opposed to professional engagement. Social media is seen by most as more useful for spreading information than obtaining it. As public discourse on a number of critical health topics continues to be influenced and sometimes shaped by discussions online from Twitter to Facebook, it would seem that greater discourse is needed about when and how public health professionals should engage in these media, and also how personal, institutional, and professional barriers to greater use of social media may be overcome.

"RCLNDAP7","thesis","2014","Kim, Kyung-Moon","The impacts of founding teams' characteristics, types of opportunities, and types of strategies on firm performance in new business ventures","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1614377123?accountid=14026","In this dissertation, I examine the impact of the characteristics of founding team on firm performance in new business ventures. In addition, this study investigates the moderating effects of the types of opportunities and the types of strategies on the relationships between founding teams' knowledge and firm performance. Although considerable research has examined the effects of founding teams' education and experience on firm performance, findings are inconclusive and disintegrated. Few studies have attempted to investigate the combined effects of these important factors on new ventures' performance and survival. As a result, this study investigates the impact of founding team knowledge acquired through formal education, industry experience, and entrepreneurial experience on firm performance, while considering the moderating effects of different types of opportunities and types of strategies. New ventures often lack resources, track-records, and reputation. Therefore, entrepreneurial founding teams' knowledge is a critical for survival and growth of new ventures. Human capital includes knowledge, skills, and experience. The knowledge-based view (KBV) explains how an individual's knowledge can be a source of competitive advantage and influence new ventures' growth and survival. Cognition theory explains how individuals' cognitive profile determines how they handle complex information in order to identify and exploit opportunities. An individual's cognitive profile can be shaped by experience. This study reviews and examines the effects of three dimensions of founding teams' knowledge, such as breadth (founding teams' education, industry experience, and entrepreneurship experience), depth (founding teams' education, industry experience, and entrepreneurship experience), and relatedness (founding teams' education and industry experience) and on firm performance in new ventures. This research, in addition, investigates the moderating effects of the types of opportunities (novelty-centered opportunities and efficiency-centered opportunities) and the types of strategies (differentiation strategies and low-cost leadership strategies) on the relationship between founding teams' knowledge and firm performance. I used archival data from  Hoovers online, Edgar, and S&P Compustat to test the effects of founding teams' knowledge and experience on firm performance. I also tested the moderating effects of the types of opportunities and the types of strategies on the relationships between founding teams' knowledge and firm performance. Empirical results provide some support for the hypotheses. The types of opportunities and the types of strategies somewhat moderate the relationship between founding teams' knowledge and firm performance in young firms. The results also provide support for the tree-way interaction effect of founding teams' knowledge, the types of opportunities, and the types of strategies on firm performance. This study contributes to the entrepreneurship literature examining the effects of specific dimensions of founding teams' knowledge and experience on firm performance. Specifically, it provides new insight into the interaction effects of the types of opportunities and founding teams' knowledge on performance, highlights moderating effects of types of strategies on the relationships between founding teams' knowledge and performance, and sheds light on the interaction effects of types of opportunities, types of strategies, and founding teams' knowledge on performance. The important implication for organization and management is that founding teams' knowledge and experience and the types of opportunities and the types of strategies should be matched. This research suggests that future research should use different data collection methods to obtain data before IPO to examine these relationships in question at the early stage of new ventures. In addition, future rese… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","2014","2020-06-05 21:21:54","2020-06-05 21:21:54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","APA PsycInfo®","1614377123; 2014-99170-104","","","Publication Title: Dissertation Abstracts International Section A: Humanities and Social Sciences AAI3577731","","","http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&genre=dissertations+%26+theses&sid=ProQ:APA+PsycInfo%C2%AE&atitle=&title=The+impacts+of+founding+teams%27+characteristics%2C+types+of+opportunities%2C+and+types+of+strategies+on+firm+performance+in+new+business+ventures&issn=&date=2014-01-01&volume=&issue=&spage=&au=Kim%2C+Kyung-Moon&isbn=&jtitle=&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-99170-104&rft_id=info:doi/","opportunities; Human; Empirical Study; Entrepreneurship; Adulthood (18 yrs & older); Quantitative Study; 3500:Educational Psychology; Strategies; Management Methods; Organizational Characteristics; Business Organizations; Business Management; firm performance; founding teams' characteristics; new business ventures; strategies; Work Teams","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Web analytics was used to track 24 home schooled participants of an online application to teach a 21 st century skill driven curriculum consisting of character driven plot story construction in a social learning environment. Additional quantitative data was collected by assignment submissions, a survey, and email exchanges with the participants. The results showed that 79.2 percent choose to engage with the application as an indicator of active choice. However, only 20.8 percent of users completed the full curriculum as an indicator of persistence by submitting a final story video. Indicator Mental Effort revealed that one fifth of the total study participants completed the scaffolded curriculum by submitting a final assignment video. Additional data suggested that curiosity may have an influence on active choice. Indicator Persistence infers that technology problems may have hampered persistence, though one outlier exhibited flow by completing the curriculum twice. As suggested by the literature, the results of this study revealed that interest was related to intrinsic motivation and engagement with the media. Additionally, instructor led feedback videos may play a role in helping learners to develop self-efficacy. This exploratory study demonstrates how meaningful measures of motivation may be used in online learning environments.

Six participants were high school students from grades 10 through 12 at a school for the visually impaired in Taiwan. They were selected by using purposeful sampling based on their use of G-mouse screen reader and experience in searching information on the Web. Qualitative research methods and case study design were used to provide detailed descriptions of participants' information searching behaviors and to learn about their understanding of accessibility and usability issues. Four sources of data collected from pre-task interviews, observations, online information search task sessions, and post-task interviews were transcribed and analyzed. This study identified information search behaviors of the participants on the Web using G-mouse screen reader and challenges they encountered during the information searching process as well as the strategies they used to overcome these challenges. Regarding the participants' action, the participants skimmed through a web page by jumping from link to link and scanning the first few words of a link. By using limited of use of G-mouse keyboard commands, the participants only looked at the first page of search results but visited more than one website per task. In relation to the participants' cognition, they chose a search engine/port or a specific website to search for information. After the participants got oriented to the search edit box automatically or by tabbing to it, they formulated the first search query from the task description and then modified the search queries with new terms found from result pages or web pages. The participants examined the search result lists based on the page title and browsed the textual content of a website by jumping through links and reading through the entire page. The participants faced six accessibility and usability problems, including graphics, Flash and tables without text alternative, navigation menu at the top, inappropriate labeling of links, the structure of specific websites, and excessive information. Searching information on the Web became a challenge for the participants when G-mouse screen reader failed to pronounce English words in an understandable way, to give indication when a web page had finished loading, and to provide sufficient feedback to verify the participants' actions. The obstacles encountered by the participants could be caused by individual's insufficient search competence, including not having the conceptual model of a web page's layout and strategies to deal with information overload. When the participants experienced problems on the Web, they employed six strategies, including note-taking, trial and error, backtracking, looking for assistance, skipping, and giving up. The recommendations for screen reader developers are to support automatic term suggestions, to provide the overview of content arrangement, and to provide a non-speech notification for a content change. The recommendations for web designers are to include auditory previews and overviews for search engines, and to provide support in keeping track of information. The recommendations for educators are to provide training in formulating effective search queries, overcoming information overload, and building mental models, and to provide students with opportunities to share experience. Future research is also discussed.

This research examined: How are INGOs adopting the innovation of mobile technology into M&E systems for health care programs in international settings, and what factors are facilitating or inhibiting this innovation? Methods: A mixed-methods approach employed key informant interviews with INGO leaders (n=12) and Platform providers (n=9) and an online survey of a broad sample of INGO personnel (n=311). The research used the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) framework to structure the data collection. Univariate and bivariate analysis of the quantitative data was conducted using SPSS Version 21 and qualitative analysis used MaxQDA Version 11. Results: Of all survey respondents, 70.6% had used mobile technology overall during the last year, 77.2% were intending to use mobile technology over the next year in their programs, and 72.6% had seen organizations like theirs using mobile technology. Only 55.7% had used mobile technology specifically for M&E applications in health. Three of the five DOI areas—tension for change, innovation–system fit, and support and advocacy—showed INGOs to be far along toward the adoption of mobile technology. Assessing the implications of adoption and dedicating time and resources to the adoption—were relatively further behind. Discussion: The research shows high levels of readiness for change in the INGO community. However, the full power of mobile technology to change the way M&E systems are built and how data are collected at a systems level has not yet taken hold. The high level of organizational readiness for change must be leveraged if organizations are going to adopt mobile technology into M&E systems. The researcher proposed a strategy to assist INGOs that would like to adopt mobile technology into M&E systems that includes disseminating the findings widely among research participants, platform providers, donors and the wider public and to repeat the survey research to track change over time.

One potential source of alcohol-related harm is the inability of students to estimate their current level of intoxication (gBAC). The current four field studies use breathalyzers to investigate student gBAC and the efficacy of a variety of BAC-feedback tools at promoting greater awareness of driving risks while under the influence of alcohol. The research was conducted across 89 nights spanning seven academic semesters from Fall 2009 to Fall 2012. Research tables were setup between the hours of 6:00pm and 2:00am at three locations near downtown bar establishments and one on-campus location near a late-night dining facility. Unique subject codes were created to track participants across multiple nights of participation. In total, 12,432 blood alcohol concentration (BAC) readings were collected from 10,225 unique individuals. Study 1 examined general epidemiology across all nights. The average BAC of drinking participants was .100 mL/L. Results revealed significant differences in BAC as a function of demographic and environmental factors. Additionally, it was found the average student was incorrect in estimating his or her BAC by .034 mL/L. Studies 2 and 3 examined the accuracy of BAC-estimation tools (i.e., nomograms, sobriety tests, and phone applications) and the efficacy of these tools to increase awareness of driving-related risks. On average, both nomograms and BAC-estimation phone applications were incorrect in estimating BAC by over .05 mL/L. Sobriety tests performed slightly better than chance at discriminating BACs of .08 mL/L. Participants receiving BAC-feedback had increased awareness of driving risk across levels of intoxication. Nomogram and breathalyzer feedback tended to promote healthier perceptions of external risk. Sobriety testing shifted the internal perception of feeling less safe to drive. No effect was observed for BAC-estimation phone applications. Study 4 found individuals who received breathalyzer feedback across multiple nights of the research were significantly more accurate at estimating their BAC. Specifically, individuals on the fifth night of participation were .017 mL/L more accurate at estimating their BAC as compared to the first night. Future research areas and policy implications are discussed.

Trends in the literature are also investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a systematic literature review, 30 key articles from 2008 to 2012 were further analysed. Findings: International companies need real-time monitoring software, expertise and dynamic visualization to facilitate early detection and prognoses supporting strategy making. This is a costly affair, prompting questions about return on investment. A recent trend in the research literature concerns the development of models describing how issues spread in social media with the aim of facilitating prognoses. Research limitations/implications: The online databases used comprised refereed peer-reviewed scientific articles. Books were not included in the search process. Practical implications: Because information spreads fast in social media and affects international companies, they need to identify issues early, in order to monitor and predict their growth. This paper discusses the difficulties posed by this objective. Originality/value: Social media monitoring is a young research area and research on the topic has been conducted from many different perspectives. Therefore, this paper brings together current insights geared towards corporate communication by international companies.

This paper describes results from the development of a mobile robot which will follow a single, unmarked pedestrian using vision. This work demonstrates an improvement over existing pedestrian following applications because (1) it uses sufficiently strong classifiers such that it does not need to adapt to any particular pedestrian, (2) uses only vision and does not rely on any laser range devices, (3) provides a single point benchmark for the level of performance required from a detector to achieve pedestrian following, and (4) its performance is characterized over several kilometers in both rainy and dry weather conditions. The system leverages Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features for pedestrian detection at over 8 Hz using video from a monochrome camera. The pedestrian’s heading is combined with distance from stereo depth data to yield a 3D estimate. A particle filter with some clutter rejection provides a continuous track, and a waypoint follow behavior servos the iRobot PackBot robot chassis to a desired location behind the pedestrian. The final system is able to detect, track, and follow a pedestrian over several kilometers in outdoor environments, demonstrating a level of performance not previously shown on a small unmanned ground vehicle.

However, large-scale collection of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) data is more challenging because such data must be collected directly from patients. Internet-based HRQOL questionnaires are a potential solution, allowing home data collection with immediate storage in a central database. Objectives: Our objectives were to investigate the sociodemographic predictors of Internet use and willingness to convey HRQOL information over the Internet in a Canadian tertiary care patient population and to determine whether Internet use patterns of tertiary care patients differ from those of the general Canadian population. Additionally, we sought to identify the success of home completion of Internet-based HRQOL questionnaires, as well as factors hindering home completion. Methods: We surveyed 644 patients at the Toronto General and St. Michael’s Hospitals from November 2003 through July 2006 within a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of HRQOL in patients with lung disease or lung transplants. Using multiple logistic regression, we assessed patient age, gender, rurality, marital status, and employment or education status as potential sociodemographic predictors of having an Internet-accessible home computer, using email at least weekly, and willingness to complete a quality of life questionnaire over the Internet. Patients electing to complete questionnaires over the Internet were followed from September 2005 through March 2008 to assess completion of HRQOL questionnaires from home, identify barriers for noncompletion, and determine sociodemographic predictors for home completion. Results: Of the 644 patients, the median age was 51 years, with a similar number of males and females. Most were urban Ontario residents, were unemployed, and were married or in a common-law relationship. Having an Internet-accessible home computer was reported by 79.7% (513/644) of patients and use of email at least weekly by 66.5% (414/623) of patients. A majority of patients (57.1% 368/644) were willing to complete HRQOL questionnaires over the Internet via an emailed link. Of the participating 644 patients, 368 elected to complete future questionnaires from home and, as part of a gradual roll-out of the home HRQOL questionnaire, 211 were sent emails inviting them to do so. Of the invited patients, 78% (165/211) completed at least one questionnaire from home. The most common reason for noncompletion was a lack of or an inability to find time to complete the questionnaire. No statistically significant sociodemographic predictors of Internet use were associated with completion or noncompletion of questionnaires from home. Conclusions: Home, Internet-based HRQOL assessment is feasible in tertiary care patient populations with a high predicted rate of Internet usage based on sociodemographic parameters.

This article reviews the development of the Teaching-to-Teach program at the University of Toronto Department of Psychiatry, the current curriculum, evaluation, and future directions of the program. The authors highlight some of the challenges encountered and discuss ideas for implementation of similar programs in diverse training settings. Methods: A Teaching-to-Teach curriculum was developed with separate tracks for junior and senior residents. Topics covered include one-to-one teaching, the one-minute clinical preceptor model, challenging teaching scenarios, and providing effective feedback. Results: In 2007, 100% of residents who responded to an evaluation questionnaire agreed or strongly agreed that the topics covered were relevant, and in 2008, 92% of respondents agreed that topics were relevant. In 2007, all respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they felt more prepared to teach. In 2008, 85% of respondents felt more prepared to teach. In 2007, all respondents felt that the amount of teaching was good or too little, but in 2008, 46% of respondents felt there was too much teaching. Conclusion : The large size of the University of Toronto psychiatry program may make this curriculum difficult to generalize to smaller training sites. The use of online modules, collaboration between programs, or individual teaching electives may be other ways of implementing a teaching to teach program. Overall, our curriculum was well-received by trainees and they felt better prepared to take on the role of teacher after participating.

Methods: A total of 29 children in grades 4 to 6 (65.5% male; 10.5 ± 1.0 years old) wore an accelerometer while participating in 2 elimination and 2 nonelimination games. Activity counts were collected using a 30-second epoch and converted to METs to determine minutes spent in sedentary behavior and light, moderate, vigorous, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Self-efficacy, enjoyment, and peer-victimization were assessed on 4 occasions (before and after 2 elimination and 2 nonelimination games). Results: Overall, girls spent more time in sedentary behavior compared with boys. Children engaged in significantly more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity during nonelimination games compared with elimination games. Furthermore, children significantly increased self-efficacy after playing both game sessions. A significant interaction between type of game and time of measurement in the prediction of enjoyment showed that enjoyment modestly increased after elimination games and slightly decreased after nonelimination games. There were no differences in peer-victimization. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence that nonelimination games provide more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity compared with elimination games, but elimination games may be more enjoyable.

This is due to tremendous difficulties in data acquisition of social systems. Massive multiplayer online games (MMOG) provide a fascinating new way of observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously socially interacting individuals engaged in virtual economic activities. We have compiled a data set consisting of practically all actions of all players over a period of 3 years from a MMOG played by 300,000 people. This large-scale data set of a socio-economic unit contains all social and economic data from a single and coherent source. Players have to generate a virtual income through economic activities to ‘survive’ and are typically engaged in a multitude of social activities offered within the game. Our analysis of high-frequency log files focuses on three types of social networks, and tests a series of social-dynamics hypotheses. In particular we study the structure and dynamics of friend-, enemy- and communication networks. We find striking differences in topological structure between positive (friend) and negative (enemy) tie networks. All networks confirm the recently observed phenomenon of network densification. We propose two approximate social laws in communication networks, the first expressing betweenness centrality as the inverse square of the overlap, the second relating communication strength to the cube of the overlap. These empirical laws provide strong quantitative evidence for the Weak ties hypothesis of Granovetter. Further, the analysis of triad significance profiles validates well-established assertions from social balance theory. We find overrepresentation (underrepresentation) of complete (incomplete) triads in networks of positive ties, and vice versa for networks of negative ties. Empirical transition probabilities between triad classes provide evidence for triadic closure with extraordinarily high precision. For the first time we provide empirical results for large-scale networks of negative social ties. Whenever possible we compare our findings with data from non-virtual human groups and provide further evidence that online game communities serve as a valid model for a wide class of human societies. With this setup we demonstrate the feasibility for establishing a ‘socio-economic laboratory’ which allows to operate at levels of precision approaching those of the natural sciences.

Guttmann’s Facet Theory was applied to study literacy as a complex, multifaceted phenomenon. With the increasing influence of digital technologies, the facet design approach was found especially suited to track the many changes occurring in presentation modalities, functions, and productive versus consumptive uses of literacy. The study shows that the facet approach was useful in pinpointing how these shifts in literacy engagement turn out differently for boys and girls. Based on self-reports via an Internet questionnaire, the study shows that girls outscored boys in every aspect of literacy, including computer and Internet based literacy practices. However, while among girls a more balanced profile was found regarding the engagement in traditional and new literacy practices, the boys reported a high preference for the new digital media. Moreover, we found that girls, compared to boys, used new literacy activities more often for educational purposes. The findings suggest that, given this more balanced profile, girls, compared to boys, are less at risk of losing touch with traditional print-based educational literacy in school.

Here we show that what consumers are searching for online can also predict their collective future behavior days or even weeks in advance. Specifically we use search query volume to forecast the opening weekend box-office revenue for feature films, first-month sales of video games, and the rank of songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, finding in all cases that search counts are highly predictive of future outcomes. We also find that search counts generally boost the performance of baseline models fit on other publicly available data, where the boost varies from modest to dramatic, depending on the application in question. Finally, we reexamine previous work on tracking flu trends and show that, perhaps surprisingly, the utility of search data relative to a simple autoregressive model is modest. We conclude that in the absence of other data sources, or where small improvements in predictive performance are material, search queries provide a useful guide to the near future.

First, this study reviews the concepts of interactivity, interactivity dimension, and interaction type on the basis of related theories and studies. Second, this study analyzes the interactive functions attributable to the six major CMSs in Taiwan colleges and universities, and re-constructs a technical framework containing five interaction types, nine interactivity dimensions, and 83 possible interactive functions. This study has found that a total of 21 interactive functions were featured in the six CMSs, while six functions identified from theories and research were not. In terms of interaction type, the results indicate that these six CMSs possessed the highest percentage of possible interactive functions for facilitating human interactions (e.g., learner–learner interaction and learner–instructor interaction), followed by learner–interface interaction and learner–self interaction, with the lowest percentage corresponding to learner–content interaction. In terms of interactivity dimension, these six CMSs seemed more likely to feature a learner-centered design approach than a system-centered one. Also, this study conducted user surveys on students’ perceptions, use, and evaluation of these interactive functions. A total of 491 valid sets of data were collected from six CMS user groups. The results indicate that, for their online learning, students considered the function of “Assignment handling” to be the most known, frequently used, and useful function. In addition, students were well familiar with, and made use of, any functions that would help them monitor or track their learning process. Students required more content-related interactive functions than were currently available in CMSs. Last, the regression results indicate that the more positively the students perceived the CMS interactivity, the usefulness of CMS for learning, and the interactive functions, the more positively these students perceived their CMSs.

Each group of four members used an online shared workspace to collaborate. Results showed that about half of the groups actively used the workspaces to share resources, negotiate ideas, and coordinate their collaboration. On the other hand, using the workspaces helped the teacher to easily track and monitor the collaborative learning process, as the workspaces documented what group members did and how they gradually completed the assignment. The students were also required to write weekly progress reports. Results showed that writing progress reports helped group members to reflect on what they had done and also provided additional information for the teacher to confirm their individual contributions.

This study examined the association between parenting behaviours and adolescent online aggression. The sample included 733 adolescents (451 females), between 10 and 18 years, from Western Canada. Participants completed a questionnaire that included questions on internet aggression, and parenting. The parenting questions were modified from Stattin and Kerr’s (2000) questionnaire to better suit the online environment. Results from the univariate least squares factor analysis revealed two distinct factors: (1) Parent Solicitation (parents ask where child is going on the internet), (2) Child Disclosure (child naturally tells parents what they are doing). Hierarchical Linear Regression analysis revealed that having a computer in the bedroom increased the likelihood of engaging in online aggression and that adolescent self-disclosure of online behaviours (and not controlling or monitoring online activities) was negatively associated with online aggression. These findings emphasize the importance of establishing good communication between parents and adolescents rather than investing money on monitoring software and on controlling adolescent internet use.

Here we report a new study examining the relationship between self-reported Ecstasy use and traces of MDMA found in hair samples. Methods: In a laboratory setting, 49 undergraduate volunteers performed an Internet-based assessment which included mood scales and the University of East London Drug Use Questionnaire, which asks for history and current drug use. They also provided a hair sample for determination of exposure to MDMA over the previous month. Results: Self-report of Ecstasy use and presence in hair samples were consistent (p < 0.00001). Both subjective and objective measures predicted lower self-reported ratings of happiness and higher self-reported stress. Self-reported Ecstasy use, but not presence in hair, was also associated with decreased tension. Conclusion: Different psychoactive drugs can influence long-term mood and cognition in complex and dynamically interactive ways. Here we have shown a good correspondence between self-report and objective assessment of exposure to MDMA. These data suggest that the Internet has potentially high utility as a useful medium to complement traditional laboratory studies into the sequelae of recreational drug use.

Other experiments are intended to evaluate the software tools that shape the cognitive work. In both cases, effective experimentation is premised on the control and factorial analysis of sources of variability. This entails programmes of experimentation. However, sociotechnical systems are generally a ‘moving target’ in terms of the pace of change. The objective of this study was to create a general approach to experimental design and the measurement of cognitive work that can satisfy the requirements for experimentation and yet can also provide a ‘fast track’ to the evaluation of software-supported cognitive work. A measure called i-bar is presented, which is the inverse of the mid-range. The statistic is derived from data on trials-to-criterion in tasks that require practice and learning. This single measure is interpreted as a conjoint measurement scale, permitting: (a) evaluation of sensitivity of the principal performance measure (which is used to set the metric for trials to criterion); (b) evaluation of the learnability of the work method (i.e. the goodness of the software tool); (c) evaluation of the resilience of the work method. It is shown that it is possible to mathematically model such order statistics and derive methods for estimating likelihoods. This involves novel ways of thinking about statistical analysis for discrete non-Gaussian distributions. The idea and method presented herein should be applicable to the study of the effects of any training or intervention, including software interventions designed to improve legacy work methods and interventions that involve creating entirely new cognitive work systems.

The main aims of this study were to determine criterion distances for ATS in Belgian older adolescents, to examine multidimensional correlates of ATS in adolescents living within a feasible distance from school and to investigate the associations of ATS with total physical activity and with other physical activities besides ATS. Methods: In total, 1281 older adolescents (17-18 years) from 20 general secondary schools in East- and West-Flanders completed a questionnaire on physical activity behaviors, demographic factors and psychosocial and physical environmental correlates of physical activity. Distance to school was objectively measured using Routenet online route planner. Results: In total, 58.4% of the participants commuted actively to school. The criterion distance for ATS could be set at eight kilometers for cycling and two kilometers for walking. For those adolescents living within a feasible distance for ATS, gender, smoking status, walkability of the neighborhood and social modeling were associated with transportation mode choice. ATS was positively associated with total physical activity, but not significantly related to min/week of other physical activities. Conclusions: For older adolescents living within eight kilometers of their school, interventions taking into account the correlates found to be related to ATS could possibly be effective to enhance ATS and to increase total physical activity levels. In the context of the overall physical activity decline in adolescence, also interventions targeting physical activity behaviors of adolescents living further away from school might be needed, but these interventions should probably emphasize alternative strategies.

The present study investigated whether severity of gambling problems and gamblers’ preference for chance or skill games were related to two sub-factors of cognitive distortions as measured by the Gamblers Belief Questionnaire: Luck/Perseverance, which reflects an individual’s perception that chance is favorable to him/her, and Illusion of Control, which reflects an individual’s perception that his/her behavior influences chance occurrences. Participants ( N = 166) were recruited from a race track ( n = 79), off-course betting facilities ( n = 50) and from an online treatment program for problem gamblers ( n = 49). Gambling severity was measured by the South Oaks Gambling Screen, and 73 were classified as pathological gamblers whereas 93 were classified as non-pathological gamblers. The present study supports previous proposals that cognitive distortions are core processes related to gambling behavior as pathological gamblers reported more cognitive distortions than did non-pathological gamblers. A preference for skill games was also associated with greater Illusion of Control compared to a preference for chance games. For gamblers preferring skill games there were no differences in Luck/Perseverance or Illusion of Control between pathological and non-pathological gamblers.

In recent years, the utility of computer-based neuropsychological assessment measures has received considerable attention in the literature, with particular emphasis on clinical applications (Schatz & Browndyke, 2002). Concussion testing and management involves testing large numbers of athletes prior to sport participation in order to document baseline cognitive performance. To this end, computer-based neuropsychological screening measures have been identified as advantageous, as paper-and-pencil tests require more time and trained personnel. Computer programs, with accurate timing, are well suited to identify neurocognitive deficits, track progress toward recovery, and assist in return-to-play decisions, especially when post-concussive symptoms include delayed onset of response time and increased decision-making times (i.e., reduced information processing speed; Schatz & Zillmer, 2003). In this regard, computerized testing has played an integral role in the assessment and diagnosis of sport-related concussion, as well as playing an important contributing role in return-to-play decisions. Despite the widespread use of computer-based assessment measures, there have been numerous issues related to their utility and implementation as a means of assessing and tracking cognitive functioning at baseline and post-concussion. This chapter discusses (1) the use of computer-based neuropsychological tests by sports medicine personnel, (2) the influence of effort on cognitive performance, (3) the necessity for repeat or updated baseline assessments, and (4) the accuracy of computer-based timing.

The interactive animation program used in this study was created with Adobe Flash following Mayer’s multimedia design principles as well as Kristof and Satran’s interactivity theory. This study was guided by three main questions: 1) Is there any difference in achievement improvement among students who use different interactive levels of an animation program? 2) Is there any difference in confidence improvement among students who use different interactive levels of an animation program? 3) Is there any difference in program perception among students who use different interactive levels of an animation program?This study was a one-way design where the independent variable was animation interactivity. In addition to a control group (Static Group) which was provided with only static materials, there were three groups with different levels of animation interactivity: 1) animation with simple interactivity (Simple Animation Group), 2) animation with input manipulation (Input Group), and 3) animation with practice and feedback (Practice Group). A sample of 123 college students participated in the study and was randomly assigned into four groups. The students used the animation program in the computer lab and then took online surveys and tests for evaluation. The subject matter of the animation program was on  Principles of Hypothesis Testing (concepts of the type I error, type II error and p-value), a difficult topic for novice learners. The data collected in this study included 1) achievement and confidence pre-test scores, 2) achievement and confidence post-test scores, and 3) program perception scores. The Web log data was recorded as an additional qualitative source. The data were analyzed by using multivariate analysis (MANOVA) and univariate analysis (ANOVA). The findings were as follows: 1) Animation interactivity impacted students’ improvement on understanding ( p = .006) and lower-level applying ( p = .042), and 2) animation interactivity did not significantly impact student confidence and program perception. Students’ lack of cognitive skills and the time limit might decrease the effect of the interactive animation. This study hoped to broaden theories on interactive learning and serve as a reference for future statistics curriculum designers and textbook publishers.

"B4JLESCG","thesis","2011","Nguyen, Van-Hai","Empirical essays in health economics","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/857127647?accountid=14026","This thesis comprises four essays on important public health issues. The first essay studies how social interactions can spread petty corruption in the health sector. Using a Vietnam dataset, I find that social interactions measured by advice on hospital choice increase the propensity of patients to give bribes to hospital staff as well as raises the bribe amount. There is also evidence on the information-transmitting role of social networks. The second essay evaluates long term health impacts of Agent Orange exposure in the VietnamWar on the Vietnamese population. I use a unique dataset that includes both self reported hypertension and objectively measured blood pressure. The results indicate that exposure to Agent Orange significantly increases the risk of having hypertension and reduce height, with the largest burden falling on the cohort born during the spraying period and on the most heavily sprayed areas. I also show that using self-reported hypertension data may lead to upward bias in the estimate of the effects of Agent Orange on hypertension. There is also evidence that exposure to Agent Orange and herbicides during the Vietnam War increases risk of cancer and mental illness. The third essay investigates a possible link between hypertension and happiness by examining possible impacts of neighborhood wealth on individuals' hypertension. Using  both self-reported and objective hypertension data to proxy for happiness, I find that self-reported hypertension rate is much lower than objectively measured hypertension rate which lead to a large discrepancy between results obtained from self-reported and objective hypertension data. Moreover, I find that high neighborhood wealth raises hypertension risks for people aged 55-65 and not for younger or older age groups. The fourth essay provides a theoretical rationale for smoking bans by proposing a theoretical model of maximizing behaviour on the part of smokers. It also empirically evaluates effects of smoking bans imposed at home and in workplace. Both calibrated model simulations and empirical results suggest that, with the exception of heavy smokers, workplace bans have relatively minor impacts on smokers while restrictions on smoking in the home are found to be of an order of importance greater.

Purpose: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a cell phone glucose monitoring system for adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their parents. Methods: The authors recruited patients with type 1 diabetes who had been diagnosed for at least 1 year. Each adolescent used the system for 6 months, filling out surveys every 3 months to measure their usability and satisfaction with the cell phone glucose monitoring system, as well as how use of the system might affect quality of family functioning and diabetes management. Results: Adolescents reported positive feelings about the technology and the service, even though a concerning number of them had significant technical issues that affected continued use of the device. Nearly all thought that the clinic involvement in monitoring testing behavior was quite acceptable. The use of the Glucophone™ did not, however, significantly change the quality of life of the adolescents, their level of conflict with their parents, their reported self-management of diabetes, or their average glycemic control within the short time frame of the study. Conclusions: As a feasibility study of the technology, this work was successful in demonstrating that cell phone glucose monitoring technology can be used in an adolescent population to track and assist in self-monitoring behavior. The authors speculate that explicitly attempting to change behavior, perhaps with the use of behavioral contracts, would enhance the technology’s ability to improve outcomes.

"JRZ5BNLP","thesis","2011","Turner, John","Ad slotting and pricing: New media planning models for new media","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/862788577?accountid=14026","This thesis focuses on the planning, scheduling, and pricing of ad slots in technology-enabled modes of advertising, including webpage banner ads, video games, electronic outdoor billboards, and the next generation of digital TV. This work contributes to practice by being the first academic work to rigorously study the scheduling of dynamic in-game advertising; contributes to the body of theory by formally studying the aggregation of audience segments using duality theory; generates managerial insights for directing pricing strategy; and makes numerous modeling contributions, hence the title: New Media Planning Models for New Media. A synopsis of the three main chapters follows.  Chapter 1: ""Scheduling of Dynamic In-Game Advertising"". Dynamic in-game advertising is a new form of advertising in which ads are served to video game consoles in real-time over the Internet. We present a model for the in-game ad scheduling problem faced by Massive Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft, and a leading global network provider of in-game ad space. Our model has two components: (1) a linear program (solved periodically) establishes target service rates, and (2) a real-time packing heuristic (run whenever a player enters a new level) tracks these service rates. We benchmark our model against Massive's legacy algorithm: When tested on historical data, we observe (1) an 80–87% reduction in make-good costs (depending on forecast accuracy), and (2) a shift in the age distribution of served ad space, leaving more premium inventory open for future sales. As a result of our work, Massive has increased the number of unique individuals that see each campaign by an average of 26% per week, and achieved 33% smoother campaign delivery, as measured by standard deviation of hourly impressions served. Chapter 2: ""Planning of Guaranteed Targeted Display Advertising"" . As targeted advertising becomes predominant across a wide variety of media vehicles, planning models become increasingly important to ad networks that need to match ads to appropriate audience segments, meet advertisers' goals, and ensure opportunities to serve advertising are not wasted. We define Guaranteed Targeted Display Advertising (GTDA) as a class of media vehicles that include webpage banner ads, video games, electronic outdoor billboards, and the next generation of digital television. We then formulate the GTDA planning problem as a transportation problem with quadratic objective. By modeling audience uncertainty, forecast errors, and the ad server's execution of the plan, we derive sufficient conditions for when a specific quadratic objective is a good surrogate for several ad delivery performance metrics. Moreover, the quadratic objective allows the construction of duality-based bounds for evaluating aggregations of the audience space, leading to two efficient algorithms for solving large problems: the first intelligently refines the audience space into successively smaller blocks, and the second uses scaling to find a feasible solution given a fixed audience space partition. We find that a little bit of disaggregation goes a long way: near-optimal schedules can often be produced despite significant aggregation. Chapter 3: ""Pricing of Targeted Advertising"". This chapter focuses on the bundling and pricing of targeted audience segments, both when delivery of impressions is guaranteed and non-guaranteed. Fundamental components of the pricing problem are modeled: the cost of guaranteeing delivery, advertisers' spending targets, capacity constraints, advertisers' heterogeneous preferences, and advertisers' uncertain willingness-to-pay. We study the pricing problem from the perspective of a single monopolistic firm selling ad space to two heterogeneous advertisers. The key bundling and pricing question is whether the seller should always agree to sell any bundle of inventory an advertiser requests.

The eye-tracker puts video cameras and infrared illuminators in front of the eye to record the position of the eye, cornea reflections, and the size of the pupil. Using the movements of one's pupil (with respect to cornea reflections), the eye-tracker tracks the movement of one's eyes, which is then mapped into locations on the screen by calibration and adjustments for head movements. With the eye-tracker, we can measure gaze locations, the time length of fixations, and pupil dilation. Hence, using the eye-tracker, we can investigate how fixations (looking at the same place for a while), saccades (fast eye movements), and pupil dilation responses (changes in pupil sizes) are related to the information on the screen and behavioral choices during an experiment. Understanding the relationship between these observables can help us to understand how human behavior in the economy can be affected by what information people acquire, where their attention is focused, what emotional state they are in, and even what brain activity they are engaged in. This is because fixations and saccades (matched with information shown on screen) indicate how people acquire information (and what they see), time lengths of fixations indicate attention, and pupil dilation responses indicate emotion, arousal, stress, pain, or cognitive load. This chapter attempts to demonstrate how these measures in pupil dilation and eye tracking can help to study human decision making processes. First we introduce video-based eye tracking and then we review the literature on pupil dilation responses and discuss issues regarding interpretation. Finally we discuss applications of pupil dilation in various tasks of decision making and conclude with a list for further reading. There is also an appendix documenting the ""standard operational procedure"" of performing eye-tracking studies using either the Eyelink II or Eyelink Remote eye-tracker, intended as a guide for readers who are interested in conducting their own eye-tracking research.

"E7S7W6PN","thesis","2011","Rose, Philip Anthony","Pragmatism not idealism: Radiohead, technopoly, and the global movement for change","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/864619326?accountid=14026","Introduction. To begin, I introduce some of the basic tenets of the media ecology perspective, and provide a brief survey of some of its foundational thinkers. I interrogate how it can be effectively utilised for the purposes of art criticism, particularly in tandem with McLuhan's notion of the 'counter-environment', and in relation to music and musical multi-media in particular. I also give outline to the affect-script theory of Silvan Tomkins, demonstrating how others might use Tomkin's work in the decoding of musical communication. Part 1 - 'Ok Computer' and its Cultural Context. In part one I explore the 'concept album' and its application to Radiohead's work, along with  Ok Computer's relation to the genre of science fiction. I provide background to what Neil Postman (1992) outlines as Technopoly, and begin my illustration of how Ok Computer functions as a counter-environment to the cultural conditions that Postman describes. Identifying him as 'Cosmic Man', I note that the album's protagonist alternates between the roles of the superhero and the anti-hero. In relation to the album's opening song 'Airbag', I explore Technopoly's connection to the 'War on Terror', commercial culture, corporate libertarianism, the global movement for change, and to the social and psychic impacts of the electric age. I also attend to Postman's proposition that television is inimical to democracy and literacy and that it is thereby abetting a new species of totalitarianism. In relation to the song's seventh track 'Fitter Happier', I describe Technopoly as it relates to 'globalisation'. Part 2 - 'Ok Computer' as Counter-Environment: the Anti-Hero. Part two explores the songs that feature Cosmic Man as the anti-hero, all of which associate him with invective feelings and violent activity. 'Paranoid Android' connects the phenomenon of information overload to Technopoly, and to its eclipsing of the traditional world-view. The song also portrays our protagonist's intolerance and scapegoating tendencies which I relate to the mimetic theory of René Girard. In this connection, I investigate the character's contempt, simulated also in 'Exit Music (for a film)', whose allusions to the violence of Shakespeare's Romeo And Juliet demonstrate how Cosmic Man provides a poor role model for the next generation, many of whom he would appear to be leading to suicide. Extrapolating the family feud to that within the global village – as 'Airbag' suggests, I correlate Technopoly with what Dwight D. Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex; with recent U.S. estrangement; and with current planetary instability. Cosmic Man's antipathy continues to feature in 'Karma Police', a song in relation to which I discuss some of Technopoly's 'invisible technologies' as well as its association with contemporary strains on identity. These latter culminate in 'Climbing up the Walls' with his personal disintegration, which likewise reflects the unravelling of traditional American society. Part 3 - 'Ok Computer' as Counter-Environment: the Hero. Part three explores the songs that feature Cosmic Man in his heroic mode, beginning with 'Subterranean Homesick Alien', which highlights his estrangement from nature, and the unintended consequences of his technological extensions upon himself, his fellow species, and his habitat. Additionally, it explores his alienation from other people, from information, from truth, from meaningful life and from the humanity of his traditional past particularly as these relate to paranoia and active citizenship, the role of scientism in Technopoly, and to moral questions. 'Let Down' explores Technopoly's debilitating erosion of meta-narratives, as well as the phenomenon I identify as 'egalitarian let down'.

Due to these challenges, many schools may practice a controversial curricular design commonly known as tracking. The purpose of this study was to explore beginning teachers' perceptions of curricular tracking. The social cognitive theory and its related motivational theories framed this study. The participants, 102 beginning teachers, completed an online survey as part inclusion in the University of Memphis' New Teacher Center mentoring program. Secondary analysis of this pre-existing data set allowed for initial exploration. Survey responses were further analyzed through a mixed methods approach that used both quantitative and qualitative procedures. Pearson chi-square test of independence showed some statistical significance suggesting a relationship between beginning teachers' perceptions of curricular tracking and certain teacher demographic characteristics. Spearman rho showed some statistically significant correlations between beginning teachers' perceptions of curricular tracking and their beliefs that students are aware of track placement by certain teachers' demographic characteristics. However, Kruskal-Wallis showed no dissonance between beginning teachers' perceptions of curricular tracking and their intent to stay at their current teaching site or in the profession. Qualitative analysis revealed the categories of Academic Aptitude and Academic Behavior as related to beginning teachers' perceptions of curricular tracked students. Academic Aptitude encompassed the themes of ability, literacy, and intellectual functioning and Academic Behavior encompassed the themes of conduct, work habits, and school interest. Between the two categories, more beginning teachers' responses related to Academic Behavior. Beginning teachers' perceptions identified behavioral attributes more often than academic abilities as defining characteristics of curricular tracked students. Further qualitative analysis showed beginning teachers believed curricular tracking does effect student motivation. However, results indicated beginning teachers had varying perceptions regarding the positive, negative, or possible effect of curricular tracking on student motivation based on students' curricular track placement.

A mixed-methods concurrent triangulation approach was used to test four research questions focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of using NWEA-MAP, the extent of its use, the extent to which math performance on the NDSA can be predicted using NWEA-MAP, and the extent to which reading performance on the NDSA can be predicted using NWEA-MAP. Survey data from 16 principals were used to conduct a qualitative analysis. A qualifying sample of historical student data was obtained from four school districts, and statistical analyses were conducted that indicated there was a significant correlation between students' NDSA math and reading test scores, and students' spring 2008 and fall 2008 MAP math and reading test scores. The survey data given by the Class A principals revealed that the advantages of using the NWEA-MAP assessment are that it can be used to track student growth over time, that it allows for early intervention and placement of students based on their strengths and weaknesses, that it provides the school with immediate feedback, that it is aligned with state standards, and that it helps school districts meet AYP. The principals reported that the disadvantages of using the NWEA-MAP assessment included loss of computer lab time due to testing, loss of instructional time, too many assessments, and test scores being of little use. Caution should be taken not to assume that a single assessment, such as the NWEA-MAP, has multiple purposes. The MAP assessment is only a small part of the total assessment picture, and it is intended to be used with other sources of data to make instructional and resource-allocation decisions. North Dakota school districts will be able to provide high-quality individualized instruction to all students if they utilize a combination of NWEA-MAP assessment data, classroom assessment data, NDSA data, and recommended services that could be provided by the North Dakota Regional Education Associations (NDREAs).

Participation in online communities on social network sites such as Twitter has been observed to influence people's behavior in diverse ways including financial decision-making and political choices, suggesting the rich potential for diverse applications ranging from information search, organization, to organizational study and reform. My work focuses on computational problems relating to extracting and tracking active communities from large-scale, dynamic, and context-rich social data. First, how can one discover communities from online social actions? I introduce  mutual awareness and transitive awareness to discover communities from online users' actions. Extensive experiments on real-world blog datasets show that an efficient algorithm based on these ideas discovers communities with excellent results. Second, how can one extract sustained evolving communities? I present FacetNet, the first generative framework, to extract communities with sustained membership and to analyze their evolutions in a unified process. The experiments suggest that by incorporating historic membership into discovering new communities, FacetNet's results are more accurate, more robust to noise than prior methods. Third, how can one extract communities with rich contexts? I present MetaFac, the first graph-based tensor factorization framework for analyzing the dynamics of rich-context social networks. Metafac consists of a novel relational hypergraph representation for modeling social data of arbitrarily many dimensions or relations and an efficient factorization method for community extraction on a given metagraph. It can discover community evolution along multiple dimensions, and the extracted community structures can be employed to predict users' potential interests on media objects such as news stories. The prediction results significantly outperform the baseline methods by an order of magnitude, suggesting the utility of leveraging rich-context with community analysis to inform future decision-making. Finally, I present two applications that leverage community analysis into understanding patterns of users' activities. COLACT discovers multi-relational structures from social media streams. ContexTour efficiently tracks the community evolution, smoothly adapts to the community changes, and visualizes the community activities in various dimensions through a novel ""contextual contour map"".

Healthy People 2020 identified as a Focus Area the need for improved interactive Health Communication and Health IT in disparate populations. Attainment of this goal includes: (1) increasing access to the Internet as essential for obtaining health information and health promotion efforts; and (2) increasing the use of electronic personal health management tools (EPHMTs) as essential for keeping track of personal health information.  Statement of the problem. For these objectives to be achieved, a more comprehensive perspective on the predictors of Internet and EPHMT use in special needs, chronically ill populations must be identified. There is currently a lack of definitive research that: (1) Explores predictors of Internet use; (2) Identifies contributing factors to use of EPHMTs; (3) Examines the acceptance of and satisfaction with EPHMTs [e.g. Continuity of Care Document (CCD)] in disparate populations of People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). With a special needs population of PLWH, the current study sought to assess technology experience by the examination of potential predictors of Internet use, to explore the perceptions of PLWH, their Healthcare Providers and Care Site Mangers regarding the implementation of a CCD and to evaluate the extent to which PLWH believe a CCD to be useful and simple to use. Procedures and methods. PLWH enrolled in a Medicaid/Managed Care plan, completed a survey that assessed predictors of health outcomes and Internet use. Pre-CCD implementation focus groups and interviews were conducted to identify factors that may potentially impact system use. CCD users completed a survey that gathered perceptions of the system's effectiveness. Results. PLWH that were younger, higher educated, with favorable perceptions of personal health, were significantly more likely to use the Internet. Qualitative results identified potential barriers to CCD use and strategies to facilitate use. CCD users believed the system to be useful in managing healthcare needs and enhancing care. Conclusions. Study results contribute to the identification of factors associated with use of the Internet and EPHMTs in a special needs population of PLWH. Results can be used to inform population-level strategies to overcome disparities, inform enhancements and modifications of existing EPHMTs, and guide future Health IT efforts.

"EMZ96W5R","thesis","2011","Hyman, Sophie I.","Exit strategies: Testing ecological prediction models of resilient outcomes in youth with histories of homelessness","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/882106844?accountid=14026","National incidence and prevalence estimates of homelessness in Canadian youth are unknown. However, a recent annual profile of shelter users in a large urban centre estimated that one in five consumers of emergency shelter services are youth. Adolescence is a period of vulnerability from developmental perspective. In their progression from childhood to adulthood, youth have multiple role transitions such as identity, autonomy, and parental separation to negotiate. Dire circumstances such as homelessness place youth at a disadvantage for attaining mastery of developmental transitions compared to their housed peers. Resilience has been defined as the maintenance of positive adaptation despite adversity. Developmentally, resilience is understood as age-appropriate functioning concurrent with vulnerability related to the adversity that might otherwise place the young person at risk for less positive adaptation. Ecological Systems Theory examines not only the most immediate aspects of youths' social context, such as social support, but also broader factors, such as resource-intensity of communities. Ecological Systems Theory considers linkages between the different levels comprising youth's social ecology. This framework is useful for understanding resilient outcomes in homeless youth because their social contexts are less insulated and protected, and are subject to differing influences than housed youth living in a traditional family unit. The purpose of this dissertation was to develop and test Ecological Resilience Prediction Models of outcomes in N = 157 youth who were homeless in October 2002 to October 2003, and N =99 youth who were re-interviewed between March 2004 to October 2005. The current study and its participants are part of the larger  Panel Study on Homelessness in Ottawa (Aubry, Klodawsky, Hay & Birnie 2003). The Panel Study was undertaken to understand pathways into and out of homelessness across purposively sampled subgroups of homeless individuals. The three resilient outcomes predicted by Ecological Resilience Prediction Models within the dissertation were becoming re-housed, returning to school, and joining the work force. Secondary analyses were conducted amongst 17 youth who had become parents between Time 1 and Time 2 interview, whose data were considered separately from the rest of the sample. Results indicated that the single predictor of becoming re-housed was shorter lifetime durations of homelessness. Female sex and re-housing (for 90 days or longer), best predicted return to school. Factors predicting employment were complex, but consistent with working long hours while attending high school in studies conducted on housed youth with respect to cumulative stress. Greater Time 1 substance use and increased size of social networks predicted employment stability at Time 2. Diminished mental health functioning and greater duration of rehousing at Time 2 were additional predictors of employment at Time 2. Although employment was associated with benefits such as re-housing and decreased alcohol use at Time 2, it was associated with reduced mental health at follow-up. Policy and research recommendations emerged from examining each resilient outcome ecologically. The United States has specific educational legislation for homeless youth (the McKenny-Vento Act), a national data system to track epidemiological statistics on homeless youth (NEO-RHYMIS), and re-housing interventions for homeless adults, the implementation of which is supported in an adolescent population based on results of this dissertation (Housing First). Future research is needed to identify methods of feasibly implementing protective education, supportive employment and immediate housing for homeless youth in Canada.

Children and adolescents with TS are commonly affected by a complex picture of comorbid disorders. Psychological conceptualization and treatment of children and adolescents with TS is a challenge for many clinicians. In response to this challenge, this project serves as a Conceptualization Guide for mental health clinicians who are working with children and adolescents with TS. The Guide is intended to aid the psychological treatment of individuals with TS by providing detailed instructions on how to conceptualize a TS case. To do so, the Guide provides information that is intended to foster an understanding of the etiological and maintaining factors of reported problems. Also, the Guide describes a structured approach to assessing, formulating, and treatment planning for a TS case. This approach includes the administration of a detailed assessment questionnaire that consists of a General Questionnaire and five Modules that are administered based on clinical judgment of necessity. The General Questionnaire consists of questions that help the clinician to gain a comprehensive picture of the history and current functioning of the child with TS. The five modules address the following comorbidities: ADHD, OCD, Anxiety Disorders, Depression and Behavioral Problems. Lastly, the Guide discusses how the assessment questionnaire forms can be used in conjunction with a computer database to track individual client data on the various targeted problems as a means to measure treatment progress and results.

Rural, lower socioeconomic and African Americans fall further behind in technology access than any other group. The purpose of this ex post facto qualitative study was to investigate parental perceptions concerning the use of home Internet among rural African-American families. The Louisiana Internet Connection (LaRINC) was inspired by the U.S. Department of Commerce's 1998 publication, Falling Through the Net II, which revealed that rural low-income African Americans were the least ""connected"" group in America. LaRINC partnered with local African Americans churches in six of the poorest rural parishes in North Louisiana to provide home computers, Internet access, and training to 50 families with school-aged children. This study explored two different sets of data that was collected through questionnaires and home Internet use during the LaRINC Project. The data consist of responses from structured interviews conducted four times as well as tracking data of all participating families' Internet access over a three-year period. The nominal data was corroborated through triangulation to ascertain if changes in parental perceptions were affected by certain types and large numbers of educational Internet access. Data analysis was conducted by coding responses in a spreadsheet for recurring themes to immerge. The research questions used to focus this study are listed below: 1. Do parents believe their children improve in school because of home Internet access? 2. Do parent perceptions of the Internet and its potential benefits change over time? 3. Do the types of Internet activities accessed affect parental perceptions of home Internet access? Changes over time did occur with an increase from the first to second interview and a drop of positive parental perceptions for the third and fourth interview averages. Forty-seven of the families from this study showed an increase of time spent on the Internet over this three-year period. Parents believed that home Internet benefited their family and their children's academic performance. They also said that grades improved and that their children did homework more consistently.

"GFQB4IKM","thesis","2011","Folta, Elizabeth Eason","Investigating the impact on student learning and outdoor science interest through Modular Serious Educational Games: A design-based research study","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/910379323?accountid=14026","In an effort to get children back outdoors and exploring the natural environment, a Modular Serious Educational Game (mSEG), Red Wolf Caper, was created as part of a design-based research study. Red Wolf Caper uses a combination of an augmented reality (AR) game and a serious educational game (SEG) to capture the students’ interest in the natural world around them. The game is set around a mystery in which red wolves in eastern North Carolina are being poisoned. The students are asked to portray the role of a wildlife biologist, botanist, or entomologist, whose job it is to determine who is poisoning the red wolves. MSEG are a new form of SEG that is divided into components or modules. Each module has to be completed before the player can move on to the next module. A module can take on any format, but must encompass the storyline of the game and end in an assessment. The study focused on three research questions. How would students improve the Red Wolf Caper mSEG? Do mSEG affect students’ understanding in environmental education concepts, specifically, collecting, evaluating, and developing an explanation for data they collected in the game and knowledge of environmental systems and biological and social implications for the reintroduction of a species? Which role within the mSEG do the students choose and what is their reasoning behind choosing that particular role? The game was tested by 81 middle school students during six sessions in June 2010. The study participants played the game and participated in design sessions. In addition, they were given a 5-question pretest/posttest, role selection survey, and Serious Educational Game Rubric (SEGR). They were asked to develop a hypothesis and provide evidence to support their hypothesis. Finally, they were asked to write a letter to a local in judge explaining the importance of the red wolf reintroduction project. Twenty-three students were selected to participate in interviews to determine how to improve the game and why they chose the role they did. The mean student score for the SEGR was 18.13 out of 28. Five categories in particular stood out as needing improvement:  rules, increasing complexity, manipulation, identity, and tutorial/practice level. Sixty-nine completed pretests/posttests final scores were analyzed using a paired t-test ( p = 0.000046). The letters to the judge showed that study participants understood scientific concepts and were able to apply them to real world settings that were only portrayed briefly in the game, such as the food chain. Study participants chose to play one of three roles: a wildlife biologist ( n = 64), an entomologist ( n = 10), and a botanist ( n = 6). Their reason behind choosing a role included interest in learning more about the topic or the profession, a previous positive experience in that field, thought the role sounded fun or exciting, the role was better than the alternatives, or misunderstood the role. The experience overall was positive for the participants. They felt they learned how to identify tracks, scat, trees, and invertebrates depending on the role they played. The AR field tests were one of their favorite parts about the game. Only one student expressed that they did not like the game, while the others not only enjoyed playing the game, but felt that is was a good educational tool. This study explores only one possibility of how mSEGs can be used in education.

"KQCE5YA2","thesis","2011","Li, Yan","Data structures and algorithms for resource scheduling in high speed networks","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/916525134?accountid=14026","Large scale scientific applications require the collaboration of geographically distributed computational resources, that are connected by high speed and dedicated networks. These distributed computational resources, together with the network connecting them, define a heterogeneous computational environment. Finding an optimal resource allocation schedule is key to providing effective and reliable computation services in this environment. This dissertation focuses on resource scheduling problems for dedicated high speed networks. We formulate a series of scheduling problems according to various scheduling needs and performance metrics. We propose a set of data structures that characterize the temporal behavior of various resources. Based on these data structures, we propose algorithms for resource allocation and path computation for each formulated scheduling problem. We develop multi-path reservation algorithms for in-advance scheduling of large file transfers from multiple sources to multiple destinations. When the requests are processed one by one in online mode, a new max-flow based greedy algorithm and four variants that adapt the  k–shortest paths and k–disjoint paths algorithms are proposed. Further, to find an earliest-finishing schedule for a batch of file transfers, a linear programming based algorithm is developed. We develop an extended network model that supports optical switches with or without wavelength converters. We customize some existing routing and resource allocation algorithms to the optical environment and study the impact of different wavelength conversion schemes for resource scheduling. We also present a novel wavelength assignment strategy that alleviates the need to keep track of the bandwidth allocation status of each wavelength. A Multiple Resource Reservation Model ( MRRM) is presented for the case when multiple types of resources are scheduled together. This model enables the monitoring and scheduling of multiple heterogeneous and distributed resources. MRRM provides a unified representation for multiple types of distributed resources, and represents resource constraints such as compatibility and accessibility. Using MRRM, we solve the Multiple Resource First Slot ( MRFS) problem based on a collection of algorithms that are customized for different request and resource types. We also consider the wavelength assignment problem in Time-domain Wavelength Interleaved Networks (TWIN). We propose a 2-step process to compute the wavelength assignment for a given set of the traffic demands. The goal of our scheduling algorithm is to find out the assignment that uses the minimum number of wavelengths. We show that this wavelength assignment problem is NP-Complete by reducing the Graph Coloring problem to it. Four greedy heuristics are presented to compute a near optimal solution within reasonable time. For each proposed algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments under various topologies and workloads to evaluate its performance and efficiency.

The primary goals of this study were to, in this particular context: (1) identify the general information seeking strategies adopted by users and determine their effectiveness; (2) reveals the characteristics of the users who prefer different strategies; and (3) identify the specific traits of users’ information seeking paths and understand factors shaping them. A representative social tagging system, Douban (http://www.douban.com/) was chosen as the research setting in order to generate empirical findings. Based on the mixed methods research design, this study consists of a quantitative phase and a qualitative phase. The former firstly involved a clickstream data analysis of 20 million clickstream records requested from Douban at the footprint, movement, and track levels. Limited to studying physical behavior, it was complemented by an online survey which captured Douban users’ background information from various aspects. In the subsequent qualitative phase, a focus group gathered a number of experienced Douban users to help interpret the quantitative results. Major findings of this study show that: (1) the general strategies include encountering, browsing by resource, browsing by tag, browsing by user/group, searching, and monitoring by user/group; (2) while browsing by resource is the most popular strategy, browsing by tag is the most effective one; (3) users preferring different strategies do not have significantly different characteristics; and (4) on users’ information seeking paths these exist two resource viewing patterns – continuous and sporadic, and two resource collecting patterns – lagged and instant, and they can be attributed to user, task, and system factors. A model was developed to illustrate the strategic and tactic layers of users’ information seeking behavior in social tagging systems. It offers a deep insight into the behavioral changes brought about by this new environment as compared to the Web in general. This model can serve as the theoretical base for designing user-oriented information seeking interfaces for social tagging systems so that the general strategies and specific tactics will be accommodated efficiently.

It has revolutionized how students and instructors interact in the educational process. Yet students in online courses continue to experience higher attrition rates than their counterparts in traditional face-to-face classes despite the advantages offered by the technology. This study examined the impact that institutional policies and practices at community colleges in the state of Texas have had on student persistence in online courses. It also examined how institutions collect and use data in addressing students’ attrition. The findings were used to identify the most effective institutional practices to share with community college systems in Texas in an effort to improve student persistence in online courses across the state. The population for the study consisted of the 50 public two-year community college and the technical college systems in the state of Texas. The study used a mixed method. A theoretical model of institutional impact on online persistence was drawn from the literature review. This model’s five categories were then used to construct a survey to collect data on institutional practices and measure the effectiveness in addressing student persistence. Four college systems were identified using the survey data that best met the five categories. Interviews were then conducted at these four college systems to produce case studies of these institutions’ practices and experiences with online persistence. The results highlighted the roles that institutions play in promoting student persistence in online programs. They revealed differences in the ways institutions define and track student success in online programs and the difficulty these differences pose in comparatively evaluating various institutions’ programs. Results lent support to the theoretical model of institutional impact on online persistence that was developed for this study, and results yielded a proposed list of promising practices to enhance student persistence in online programs in public two-year community and technical colleges.

"G23BPX53","thesis","2011","Lewis, Mitzi","A hierarchical regression analysis of the relationship between blog reading, online political activity, and voting during the 2008 presidential campaign","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/921295690?accountid=14026","The advent of the Internet has increased access to information and impacted many aspects of life, including politics. The present study utilized Pew Internet & American Life survey data from the November 2008 presidential election time period to investigate the degree to which political blog reading predicted online political discussion, online political participation, whether or not a person voted, and voting choice, over and above the predication that could be explained by demographic measures of age, education level, gender, income, marital status, race/ethnicity, and region. Ordinary least squares hierarchical regression revealed that political blog reading was positively and statistically significantly related to online political discussion and online political participation. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis indicated that the odds of a political blog reader voting were 1.98 the odds of a nonreader voting, but vote choice was not predicted by reading political blogs. These results are interpreted within the uses and gratifications framework and the understanding that blogs add an interpersonal communication aspect to a mass medium. As more people use blogs and the nature of the blog-reading audience shifts, continuing to track and describe the blog audience with valid measures will be important for researchers and practitioners alike. Subsequent potential effects of political blog reading on engagement, discussion, and participation will be important to understand as these effects could impact the political landscape of this country and, therefore, the world.

Data Sources: Online Survey of Certification and Reporting (OSCAR) data for 202 free-standing NHs, Medicare Denominator, claims (parts A and B), and MDS assessments for 60,984 people who were present in one of these NHs in 2006. Methods: The algorithm creating the RHF is outlined and the RHF for the study data are used to describe place of death. The identification of residents in NHs is compared with the reports in OSCAR and part B claims. Principal Findings: The RHF correctly identified 84.8 percent of part B claims with place-of-service in NH, and it identified 18.3 less residents on average than reported in the OSCAR on the day of the survey. The RHF indicated that 17.5 percent non-Medicare NH decedents were transferred to the hospital to die versus 45.6 percent skilled nursing facility decedents. Conclusions: The population-based design of the RHF makes it possible to conduct policy-relevant research to examine the variation in the rate and type of health care transitions across the United States.

The present study tests the hypothesis that the motivation to be active or sedentary is correlated with weight change when children reduce their sedentary behavior. Methods: The motivation to be active or sedentary, changes in weight, and accelerometer assessed physical activity were collected for 55 families with overweight/obese children who participated in a nine-week field study to examine behavior and weight change as a function of reducing sedentary behavior. Children were studied in three 3-week phases, baseline, reduce targeted sedentary behaviors by 25% and reduce targeted sedentary behaviors by 50%. The targeted sedentary behaviors included television, video game playing, video watching, and computer use. Results: The reinforcing value of sedentary behavior but not physical activity, was correlated with weight change, as losing weight was associated with lower reinforcing value of sedentary behaviors. Reducing sedentary behavior was not associated with a significant change in objectively measured physical activity, suggesting the main way in which reducing sedentary behavior influenced weight change is by complementary changes in energy intake. Estimated energy intake supported the hypothesis that reducing sedentary behaviors influences weight by reducing energy intake. Conclusions: These data show that the motivation to be sedentary limits the effects of reducing sedentary behavior on weight change in obese children.

We are using social network analysis to track the development of a new interdisciplinary collaboration on complex interventions to improve population health. It involves nineteen scholars across four countries. We report the Baseline network of formal relationships among the scholars, along with the impact of the collaboration on these relationships in the first 18 months. We observed statistically significant increases in the density of six types of relationship networks: citing publications by other members of the collaboration, email contact, meeting with each other (outside of the formal annual meeting), visiting one another’s institution, submitting research grants together and working on research projects together. The initial strategic role in the network of key ‘gate keepers’ has not altered substantially (betweenness centralization of the networks), but reciprocity has increased, that is, people are more likely to cite those who have cited them and work together. Increased collaboration is also reflected in the rise in number of subgroups over time and the increase in the average number of subgroup memberships. Use of social network analysis to understand the dynamics of interdisciplinary collaborations is a relatively new field. It invites reflection about what the optimal network structures for interdisciplinary collaborations would look like.

In our classic machine learning approach to BCIs, the participants undertake a calibration measurement without feedback to acquire data to train the BCI system. After the training, the user can control a BCI and improve the operation through some type of feedback. However, not all BCI users are able to perform sufficiently well during feedback operation. In fact, a non-negligible portion of participants (estimated 15%-30%) cannot control the system (a BCI illiteracy problem, generic to all motor-imagery-based BCIs). We hypothesize that one main difficulty for a BCI user is the transition from offline calibration to online feedback. In this work, we investigate adaptive machine learning methods to eliminate offline calibration and analyze the performance of 11 volunteers in a BCI based on the modulation of sensorimotor rhythms. We present an adaptation scheme that individually guides the user. It starts with a subject-independent classifier that evolves to a subject-optimized state-of-the-art classifier within one session while the user interacts continuously. These initial runs use supervised techniques for robust coadaptive learning of user and machine. Subsequent runs use unsupervised adaptation to track the features' drift during the session and provide an unbiased measure of BCI performance. Using this approach, without any offline calibration, six users, including one novice, obtained good performance after 3 to 6 minutes of adaptation. More important, this novel guided learning also allows participants with BCI illiteracy to gain significant control with the BCI in less than 60 minutes. In addition, one volunteer without sensorimotor idle rhythm peak at the beginning of the BCI experiment developed it during the course of the session and used voluntary modulation of its amplitude to control the feedback application.

Additionally, the relationship between study methods and effect size (ES) in HPE research is unknown. Objectives: This review aimed to evaluate, in a sample of experimental studies of Internet-based instruction, the quality of reporting, the relationship between reporting and methodological quality, and associations between ES and study methods. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of databases including MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, EMBASE and ERIC, for articles published during 1990–2008. Studies (in any language) quantifying the effect of Internet-based instruction in HPE compared with no intervention or other instruction were included. Working independently and in duplicate, we coded reporting quality using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement, and coded study methods using a modified Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (m-NOS), the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI), and the Best Evidence in Medical Education (BEME) global scale. Results: For reporting quality, articles scored a mean ± standard deviation (SD) of 51 ± 25% of STROBE elements for the Introduction, 58 ± 20% for the Methods, 50 ± 18% for the Results and 41 ± 26% for the Discussion sections. We found positive associations (all p < 0.0001) between reporting quality and MERSQI ( ρ = 0.64), m-NOS ( ρ = 0.57) and BEME ( ρ = 0.58) scores. We explored associations between study methods and knowledge ES by subtracting each study’s ES from the pooled ES for studies using that method and comparing these differences between subgroups. Effect sizes in single-group pretest/post-test studies differed from the pooled estimate more than ESs in two-group studies (p = 0.013). No difference was found between other study methods (yes/no: representative sample, comparison group from same community, randomised, allocation concealed, participants blinded, assessor blinded, objective assessment, high follow-up). Conclusions: Information is missing from all sections of reports of HPE experiments. Single-group pre-/post-test studies may overestimate ES compared with two-group designs. Other methodological variations did not bias study results in this sample.

We describe these five levels when comprehension succeeds and also when there are communication misalignments and comprehension breakdowns. A computer tool has been developed, called Coh-Metrix, that scales discourse (oral or print) on dozens of measures associated with the first four discourse levels. The measurement of these levels with an automated tool helps researchers track and better understand multilevel discourse comprehension. Two sets of analyses illustrate the utility of Coh-Metrix in discourse theory and educational practice. First, Coh-Metrix was used to measure the cohesion of the text base and situation model, as well as potential extraneous variables, in a sample of published studies that manipulated text cohesion. This analysis helped us better understand what was precisely manipulated in these studies and the implications for discourse comprehension mechanisms. Second, Coh-Metrix analyses are reported for samples of narrative and science texts in order to advance the argument that traditional text difficulty measures are limited because they fail to accommodate most of the levels of the multilevel discourse comprehension framework.

Aggregated log data was also analyzed to see if students’ use was consistent with their beliefs. Respondents from both campuses rate highly all activities and tools within the LMS. Findings suggest that residential students value activities and tools supporting LC interaction more than commuter students, while commuter students value activities and tools fostering LL interactions more than residential students.

The research followed a situated cognitive engineering approach, which included a domain analysis, scenarios and claims analysis based on experts reviews (N = 10), user evaluations, and a case study. This resulted in the identification of nine core application functions: (1) provide a flexible way of storytelling, (2) provide a structured way of storytelling, (3) prevent losing track of changed and added events, (4) ensure patient trust, (5) ensure usage for therapists with different backgrounds, (6) ensuring awareness of treatment, (7) provide a personal approach, (8) prevent unexpected exposure to emotional material, (9) and ensure appealing and motivating approach throughout the therapy. These functions formed the basis for the design of a military multi-modal memory restructuring (Military—3MR) system, which focuses on restructuring and relearning of past events. The system allows patient and therapist to visualise past events using personal photos, narrative text, online geographical maps, webcam snapshots, and patient created 3D virtual worlds. Results of the usability evaluation (N = 18) suggests key design features such as the time line, content manage, and the 3D world editor, of an acceptable perceived usability level. Results of a storytelling experiment (N = 18) between telling an autobiographical story with or without Military-3MR system, found that with the system, time referencing and event description were more precise, and a smaller time period in the story was covered. In the case study, the veteran suffering from combat-related PTSD was pleased with the system and felt encouraged talking about his past events.

Data were collected annually among students from 6th–8th grade and then at age 17–18. Tracking procedures were used to maintain contact with participants and data collection consisted of three phases: (1) Internet- and mail-based surveys; (2) in-school survey administration; and (3) courier service delivery. Contact was lost with 11% of this urban cohort from the end of the PNC intervention activities through these longterm follow-up efforts, as indicated by returned locating postcards. Fifty-three percent of the cohort responded to the survey, the majority completing in Phase 1 of our data collection. Additional school-based and courier-delivery efforts increased our response rate by 11.5%. Costs per completed survey were $118 in Phase 1, $166 in Phase 2, and $440 in Phase 3. This study illustrates that it is possible to track and follow-up a high-risk cohort as they progress through adolescence, even with minimal efforts in intervening years.

Yet a question crucial for relating behavior to neural activity remains unresolved: what fraction of a subject's reaction time (RT) is devoted to the perceptual evaluation step, as opposed to executing the motor report? Making such timing measurements accurately is complicated because RTs reflect both sensory and motor processing, and because speed and accuracy may be traded. To overcome these problems, we designed the compelled-saccade task, a two-alternative forced-choice task in which the instruction to initiate a saccade precedes the appearance of the relevant sensory information. With this paradigm, it is possible to track perceptual performance as a function of the amount of time during which sensory information is available to influence a subject's choice. The result—the tachometric curve—directly reveals a subject's perceptual processing capacity independently of motor demands. Psychophysical data, together with modeling and computer-simulation results, reveal that task performance depends on three separable components: the timing of the motor responses, the speed of the perceptual evaluation, and additional cognitive factors. Each can vary quickly, from one trial to the next, or can show stable, longer-term changes. This novel dissociation between sensory and motor processes yields a precise metric of how perceptual capacity varies under various experimental conditions and serves to interpret choice-related neuronal activity as perceptual, motor, or both.

By recording a video of the computer screen while L2 learners (L1 French) were listening to an MP3-track in German, this study uses a novel approach and recent developments in computer technology to examine objectively what learners do while listening. The videos of the participants' screens show the movements of the mouse and its time-course, and therefore the pauses and the backward or forward movements learners do in order to master their listening task. In this study, ""self-regulation"" indicates the capacity of the listener to exercise physical control over the listening input by using the mouse. Our point is that the recorded physical movements of the mouse during the listening task are a good indicator of metacognitive activity. This is independent of what the learner reports. The data and the time-courses of the mouse were then analyzed, from both a psycholinguistic and a linguistic point of view. This enabled us, on the one hand, to define a typology of listening strategies depending on the initial level of the participants and to show that, on the whole, the opportunity to have personal control over information input/intake does improve all the learners' information processing. On the other hand, tracking the movements of the mouse while a learner individually listens to an oral text on a computer also has a methodological interest and equally allowed us to verify some precise research hypotheses about the links between linguistic features, for example, place of German compounds and final position of the verb in a subordinate clause, self-regulation strategies and comprehension.

Only limited information is available about the use of eHealth technologies among specific patient groups. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the factors that influence the initial and long-term use of a Web-based application (DiabetesCoach) for supporting the self-care of patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: A mixed-methods research design was used for a process analysis of the actual usage of the Web application over a 2-year period and to identify user profiles. Research instruments included log files, interviews, usability tests, and a survey. Results: The DiabetesCoach was predominantly used for interactive features like online monitoring, personal data, and patient–nurse email contact. It was the continuous, personal feedback that particularly appealed to the patients; they felt more closely monitored by their nurse and encouraged to play a more active role in self-managing their disease. Despite the positive outcomes, usage of the Web application was hindered by low enrollment and nonusage attrition. The main barrier to enrollment had to do with a lack of access to the Internet (146/226, 65%). Although 68% (34/50) of the enrollees were continuous users, of whom 32% (16/50) could be defined as hardcore users (highly active), the remaining 32% (16/50) did not continue using the Web application for the full duration of the study period. Barriers to long-term use were primarily due to poor user-friendliness of the Web application (the absence of “push” factors or reminders) and selection of the “wrong” users; the well-regulated patients were not the ones who could benefit the most from system use because of a ceiling effect. Patients with a greater need for care seemed to be more engaged in long-term use; highly active users were significantly more often medication users than low/inactive users ( P = .005) and had a longer diabetes duration ( P = .03). Conclusion: Innovations in health care will diffuse more rapidly when technology is employed that is simple to use and has applicable components for interactivity. This would foresee the patients’ need for continuous and personalized feedback, in particular for patients with a greater need for care. From this study several factors appear to influence increased use of eHealth technologies: (1) avoiding selective enrollment, (2) making use of participatory design methods, and (3) developing push factors for persistence. Further research should focus on the causal relationship between using the system’s features and actual usage, as such a view would provide important evidence on how specific technology features can engage and captivate users.

GreatFun2Run was a school-based healthy lifestyles intervention that showed positive changes in physical activity levels and body composition immediately post-intervention. The purpose of this paper was to examine whether these changes in physical activity and body composition were maintained 18- 20 months after the intervention ended. Method: Participants (n = 589, aged 7-11 yrs) from 4 intervention and 4 control schools took part in the 10-month intervention, of which 421 (71%) were present for follow-up. The intervention comprised a CD-rom learning and teaching resource for teachers; an interactive website for pupils, teachers and parents; two highlight physical activity events (1 mile school runs/walks); a local media campaign; and a summer activity wall planner and record. Randomisation was not possible because of local media content. Outcome measures were objectively measured physical activity (pedometers and accelerometers) and body composition variables (body mass index, waist circumference, estimated percent body fat, and sum of skinfolds). Teacher interviews and participant focus groups were conducted. Multi-level modelling was employed for the data analysis. Results: Both control and intervention participants had increased their physical activity at follow-up but there was no group by time interaction (control: 2726 steps per day increase; intervention 3404 steps per day increase, p > .05). There were significant increases in estimated percent body fat, sum of skinfolds, waist circumference and body mass index (BMI) with increasing age. In the control group, there was evidence for a plateauing in the rate of change in all body composition variables with increasing age, except BMI. In contrast, significant interaction terms suggest that the rate of change in waist circumference, BMI and BMISDS continued to increase with age in the intervention group. Teacher interviews suggested that because of time pressures, competing resources, curriculum demands and staff changes the majority of teachers had not continued to use the resources. Conclusions: While the intervention initially produced positive changes in physical activity levels and body composition, these changes were not sustained once the intervention ended. Facilitating long-term health behaviour change in children remains a challenge.

The authors improve on conventional web crawling methodologies in a number of significant ways: First, the authors track blogging activity as it occurs, by scraping new blog posts when such posts are announced through Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds. Second, the authors use custom-made tools that distinguish between the different types of content and thus allow us to analyze only the salient discursive content provided by bloggers. Finally, the authors are able to examine these better quality data using both link network mapping and textual analysis tools, to produce both cumulative longer term maps of interlinkages and themes, and specific shorter term snapshots of current activity that indicate current clusters of heavy interlinkage and highlight their key themes. In this article, the authors discuss findings from a yearlong observation of the Australian political blogosphere, suggesting that Australian political bloggers consistently address current affairs, but interpret them differently from mainstream news outlets. The article also discusses the next stage of the project, which extends this approach to an examination of other social networks used by Australians, including  Twitter, YouTube, and Flickr. This adaptation of our methodology moves away from narrow models of political communication, and toward an investigation of everyday and popular communication, providing a more inclusive and detailed picture of the Australian networked public sphere.

This term refers to gambling from a centralized account that is linked to an identified individual. Player account-based gambling is increasingly being utilized for multiple forms of Internet, mobile and land-based gambling through player cards and user-names. Player accounts track and store a wealth of data on gambling behaviour and related activities. Gambling research has been justifiably criticized for its reliance on self-report rather than behavioural measures. Research analysing player account data may advance conceptual models, identify behavioural risk factors for problem gambling and evaluate and guide effective policy and responsible gambling programmes. Although research utilizing player account data has unique limitations, it offers considerable benefits for researchers, operators and regulators. Research methodology incorporating the use of player account data stands to make significant contributions to the gambling field.

Insight into the determinants of active commuting is needed, to promote such behavior in children living within a feasible commuting distance from school. This study determined feasible distances for walking and cycling to school (criterion distances) in 11- to 12-year-old Belgian children. For children living within these criterion distances from school, the correlation between parental perceptions of the environment, the number of motorized vehicles per family and the commuting mode (active/passive) to school was investigated. Methods: Parents (n = 696) were contacted through 44 randomly selected classes of the final year (sixth grade) in elementary schools in East- and West-Flanders. Parental environmental perceptions were obtained using the parent version of Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale for Youth (NEWS-Y). Information about active commuting to school was obtained using a self-reported questionnaire for parents. Distances from the children’s home to school were objectively measured with Routenet online route planner. Criterion distances were set at the distance in which at least 85% of the active commuters lived. After the determination of these criterion distances, multilevel analyses were conducted to determine correlates of active commuting to school within these distances. Results: Almost sixty percent (59.3%) of the total sample commuted actively to school. Criterion distances were set at 1.5 kilometers for walking and 3.0 kilometers for cycling. In the range of 2.01-2.50 kilometers household distance from school, the number of passive commuters exceeded the number of active commuters. For children who were living less than 3.0 kilometers away from school, only perceived accessibility by the parents was positively associated with active commuting to school. Within the group of active commuters, a longer distance to school was associated with more cycling to school compared to walking to school. Conclusions: Household distance from school is an important correlate of transport mode to school in children. Interventions to promote active commuting in 11-12 year olds should be focusing on children who are living within the criterion distance of 3.0 kilometers from school by improving the accessibility en route from children’s home to school.

By merging Web traffic and sales data from a small-sized U.S. firm, we create an individual customer-level panel that tracks all repeated purchases, both online and off-line, and tracks whether or not these purchases were referred from Google search advertising. To estimate the customer lifetime value, we apply the methodology in the customer relationship management literature by developing an integrated model of customer lifetime, transaction rate, and gross profit margin, allowing for individual heterogeneity and a full correlation of the three processes. Results show that customers acquired through Google search advertising in our data have a higher transaction rate than customers acquired from other channels. After accounting for future purchases and spillover to off-line channels, the calculated value of new customers using our approach is much higher than the value obtained using conventional method. The approach used in our study provides a practical framework for firms to evaluate the long-term profit impact of their search advertising investment in a multichannel setting.

However, previous studies relied on recalled self-reports, and the relationship has not been confirmed prospectively and objectively in a daily life situation. Recently, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) using electronic diaries, i.e., computerized EMA, is used to record subjective symptoms with the advantages of avoiding recall bias and faked compliance in daily settings. In addition, actigraphy has become an established method to assess sleep outside laboratories. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the within-individual effect of sleep on the following momentary headache intensity in TTH patients during their daily lives utilizing EMA and actigraphy. Methods: Twenty-seven patients with TTH wore watch-type computers as electronic diaries for seven consecutive days and recorded their momentary headache intensity using a visual analog scale of 0-100 approximately every six hours, on waking up, when going to bed, and at the time of headache exacerbations. They also recorded their self-report of sleep quality, hours of sleep and number of awakenings with the computers when they woke up. Physical activity was continuously recorded by an actigraph inside the watch-type computers. Activity data were analyzed by Cole’s algorithm to obtain total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset and number of awakenings for each night. Multilevel modeling was used to test the effect of each subjective and objective sleep-related variable on momentary headache intensity on the following day. Results: Objectively measured total sleep time was significantly positively associated with momentary headache intensity on the following day, while self-reported sleep quality was significantly negatively associated with momentary headache intensity on the following day. Conclusions: Using computerized EMA and actigraphy, longer sleep and worse sleep quality were shown to be related to more intense headache intensity on within-individual basis and they may be precipitating or aggravating factors of TTH.

The research also resulted in more than 400 pieces of creative in 28 languages (59 including the Web site) that comprised the campaign. With such aggressive goals and only a 4-week window to deliver results, it was critical to identify the early indicators of participation in the census and monitor them continuously throughout the campaign to determine whether efforts were on track. In addition, an exploratory module consisting of up to five questions was updated periodically to capture public reactions to current events related to the census. Social media tracking was also used to monitor conversations about the census. In addition to the three examples presented, our tracking efforts led to a dozen rapid actions that optimized the 2010 Census campaign while still in-market. Of course, the Census Bureau also tracked actual mail-back rates right down to the census tract level. These data were reviewed daily and provided the real proof that our campaign and course-correction measures were working and that we were on track to meet our goal.

Online surveys were used to assess variables associated with attrition. Online interventions and an intensive test review protocol were used as intervention methods. Across the nine nursing programs, 898 students participated in the study. Regression and categorical data analysis revealed that lack of reading comprehension was the best predictor of a student being off track or out of a nursing program ( P < .0001). Two other highly predictive variables of attrition were entrance examination composite scores ( P = .0271) and a student's grades in anatomy and physiology ( P = .005). Grant intervention protocols were effective in reducing the attrition rate ( P = .0002) between students who participated during the grant period and those prior to implementation of the grant.

Correlation and regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between 29 potential correlates across multiple domains (demographic, biological, psychosocial, behavioral, and physical environmental) and sedentary behavior measured by accelerometry in preschool children. Results: Girls spent more time in sedentary behavior than boys (33.2 vs 32.4 minutes/hour;  P = .05). Six and 8 potential correlates were found to be significant in univariate analyses for boys and girls, respectively. In the gender-specific final model, for boys, a child’s weekday TV/video games and physical activity equipment in the home were significant correlates of sedentary behavior ( R² = 0.091). For girls, BMI z score and child’s athletic coordination were significantly associated with sedentary behavior ( R² = 0.069). Conclusion: Several factors were identified as correlates of objectively measured sedentary behavior in American preschool children. However, there were no common correlates that influenced sedentary behavior for both boys and girls. Future interventions for reducing sedentary behavior could target correlates identified in this study.

Twenty-five participants completed a track on a bicycle while listening to music with two standard earbuds, with one earbud, and with two in-earbuds. Conditions with high tempo music and loud volume were also included in the experiment, as were two mobile phone conditions, one in which participants operated the phone hand held and one handsfree condition. Cycle speed was not affected by listening to music, but was reduced in the telephone conditions. In general the response to auditory signals worsened when participants listened to music, in particular when listening with in-earbuds loud auditory stop signals were missed in 68% of the cases. However, when listening with only one standard earbud performance was not affected. In the conditions when participants listened to high volume and to high tempo music, the auditory stop signal was also heard in significantly fewer cases. Completing a task on the mobile phone, using both handheld and handsfree sets, resulted in increased response time to an auditory stop signal and also reduced overall auditory perception. Furthermore, handsfree operation only had minor advantages opposed to hand held operation, with only response time to an auditory stop signal resulting in faster performance. This is likely to be related to the fact that both hands could be used for braking. It is concluded that listening to music worsens auditory perception, in particular if inearbuds are used. Furthermore, both handheld and handsfree operation of mobile phones has a negative effect on perception, potentially forming a threat to cyclist traffic safety.

Sallet et al. used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to look for variations in brain anatomy in 23 adult monkeys housed in groups of two to seven, plus one monkey housed alone. The authors found increased gray matter in the amygdala of monkeys housed in larger groups. This structure deep in the temporal lobes is best known as a hub of emotional regulation. Monkeys housed in larger groups had more gray matter in several regions of the temporal cortex, including the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Previous monkey studies have found that neurons in this region fire in response to faces and body movements and seem to track where other individuals are directing their attention. Gray matter may increase in the STS in response to a growing need to decode the expressions, gestures, and movements of more individuals as social network size increases, the researchers suggest.

Here we used single-molecule imaging with simultaneous whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings to track quantum dot-labeled P2X2 receptors in the dendrites of rat hippocampal neurons to explore P2X2 receptor mobility and its regulation. We find that plasma membrane P2X2 receptor lateral mobility in dendrites is heterogeneous but mostly Brownian in nature, consisting of mobile and slowly mobile receptor pools. Moreover, lateral mobility is P2X2 subunit and cell specific, is increased in an activation-dependent manner, and is regulated by cytosolic VILIP1, a calcium binding protein. Our data provide the first direct measures of P2X receptor mobility and show that P2X2 receptors are mobile ATP sensors, sampling more of the dendritic plasma membrane in response to ATP.

Our overall aims were (1) to describe survivorship services, including the extent of services provided, resources (personnel, philanthropy, and research funding), billing practices, and barriers to care and 2) to describe models of care that are in use for childhood cancer survivors and adult survivors of childhood cancer. Methods: One hundred seventy-nine of 220 COG institutions (81%) completed an Internet survey in 2007. Results: One hundred fifty-five (87%) reported providing survivorship care. Fifty-nine percent of institutions provide care for their pediatric population in specialized late effects programs. For adult survivors, 47% of institutions chose models of care, which included transitioning to adult providers for risk-based health care, while 44% of institutions keep survivors indefinitely at the treating institution (Cancer Center Based Model without Community Referral). Sixty-eight percent provide survivors with a copy of their survivorship care plan. Only 31%of institutions provide a detailed summary of results after each clinic visit, and 41% have a database to track survivor health outcomes. Minimal time required for initial and annual survivorship visits is estimated to be approximately 120 and 90 min, respectively. The most prevalent barriers to care were the lack of dedicated time for program development and a perceived insufficient knowledge on the part of the clinician receiving the transition referral. Conclusions: Not all COG institutions provide dedicated survivorship care, care plans, or have databases for tracking outcomes. Transitioning to adult providers is occurring within the COG. Survivorship care is time intensive.

Therefore, to address these gaps in the literature, the purpose of the present study was to examine the association between objectively-measured physical activity and a variety of self-reported sleeping parameters in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults of all ages. Methods: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2006 were used in the analyses. 3081 adults ranging in age between 18 and 85 were included in the analyses. At the mobile examination center, participants were asked to wear an ActiGraph 7164 accelerometer on the right hip for 7 days following their examination. Questions on sleep were asked during the household interview. Results: After controlling for age, bmi, health status, smoking status, and depression, the relative risk of often feeling overly sleepy during the day compared to never feeling overly sleepy during the day decreased by a factor of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.44-0.97) for participants meeting physical activity guidelines compared to those not meeting guidelines. Similar results were also found for having leg cramps while sleeping and having difficulty concentrating when tired. Conclusions: Objectively-measured physical activity was associated with several self-reported sleeping-related parameters. Future experimental studies are required to confirm that increasing physical activity causes improvements in these parameters.

How college undergraduates manage challenges with alcohol, drugs, tobacco, sex, stress, sleep, exercise, and diet can shape their current and future health habits and status. Health risk behaviors can result in outcomes that damage lives, threaten individual academic success, and jeopardize college retention. Online health education (e-Health) is an emerging intervention modality that offers cost-effective mass delivery of health information, with the potential for broad benefits. Questions remain regarding levels of student engagement with e-Health programs and the influence of demographic and personality traits on engagement. The purpose of this dissertation is to identify effective methods for measuring undergraduate engagement with health education websites and to assess differential website engagement and associated student characteristics.  Methods. This study used a multi-method design involving all class years of full- and part-time students (18–24 years) at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts. One hundred thirty-eight of the original 209 study volunteers completed the baseline survey, accessed the study website, MyStudentBody (MSB), during the nine-week viewing period, and completed the post-engagement survey. Major categories of measurement included baseline measures of sociodemographic and psychobehavioral characteristics (predictor variables) and subsequent measures of website engagement including MSB utilization tracking data, and website engagement surveys (outcome variables). Cohorts of study and non-study students participated in post-study focus group discussions. Results. Findings showed rapidly declining website engagement over the nine-week access period and significant student non-engagement overall, despite regular use of incentive offers and email prompts. Quantitative findings showed no significant statistical associations between predictor and outcome measures. Qualitative data presented recurrent themes including factors that discouraged and encouraged participant e-Health program use. Conclusion. Further study is necessary to examine the potential predictors of undergraduate engagement in online health education. Study focus groups revealed patterns of student behaviors, beliefs, and preferences that can help explain content avoidance and point to student-centered strategies that can improve engagement in MSB and similar e-Health products.

"KPH6Z6CD","thesis","2012","Mercer, Aaron Jeffrey","Architecture of the photoreceptor ribbon synapse: L-type voltage-gated calcium channel mobility and the role of cholesterol in neurotransmission","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1018477418?accountid=14026","Visual sensory transduction by the retina requires that photoreceptors efficiently transmit glutamatergic signals to bipolar and horizontal cells. Anatomical and physiological evidence suggests a tight proximity between synaptic L-type voltage-gated (Ca V) channels and the vesicle release machinery. However, advances in single particle tracking indicate that synaptic proteins are highly mobile, calling into question some of the spatial constraints at many synapses. To study the mobility of single Ca V channels at the terminals of rod and cone photoreceptors, we developed a single particle tracking technique using quantum dots attached to an extracellular Ca V channel subunit. We observed that Ca V channels track to a confinement area slightly larger than the photoreceptor active zone. Brief depolarizing stimuli releasing ∼20 vesicles caused a significant projection of Ca V channels to the active zone periphery that returned to central positions within 100 ms, indicating that release can disorganize the synapse for a brief time. Additionally, we discovered that disrupting the cytoskeleton or depleting membrane cholesterol significantly enhanced the size of a Ca V channel confinement domain. Thus, these two molecules may play a direct role in organizing the active zone by corralling Ca 2+ channels near release sites. Ultra-structural evidence shows a concentration of cholesterol at the photoreceptor active zone, but the physiological role of this lipid is not clear. To further study the effects of cholesterol manipulation at the cone photoreceptor synapse, we used electrophysiological techniques to directly examine these effects on vesicle release in the outer retina. Depletion of synaptic plasma membrane cholesterol produced a significant latency in neurotransmission, and isolating cone versus second-order neuron contributions indicates that the lag is produced primarily by a release defect in cones. Together, our data reveal that photoreceptor synapses are highly dynamic and are able to adapt to maintain a high rate of vesicle release, contingent on mobile proteins and lipid partitions to organize the terminal. A malleable, but functional synaptic terminal is necessary for the visual system to function over a wide range of light intensities.

"42GC4IGJ","thesis","2012","Hijazi, Rabeh Robert","Exploring the use of smart phones to influence healthy behaviors","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1018477445?accountid=14026","Although a number of technology interventions have been designed to address obesity on a macro level (e.g., Internet, mobile phones, and barcode scanners), a gap still existed for an effective intervention that involved the utilization of a smart phone application. Therefore, a quantitative pretest-posttest control group study was designed to explore the impact of a smart phone application (MyFitnessPal) to influence healthy behaviors and track calories for 40 days. The self-determination theory (SDT), a motivation theory used to understand health behaviors, served as the theoretical foundation. The key research questions were aimed at determining whether changes occurred in dietary, physical activity or sedentary behavior after implementing the intervention. The quantitative pretest-posttest control group design consisted of 32 control and 32 experiment participants. An ANCOVA analysis and the Holm-Bonferroni method, utilized for multiple comparisons, indicated that the intervention group improved statistically compared to the control group in healthy eating and physical activity behaviors but there was no difference between the two groups in sedentary activities. The study contributes to the literature by validating the positive outcomes of utilizing smart phones to monitor accurately long-term dietary and physical activities. The study contributes to positive social change by showing how tracking calories via smart phones could encourage users to make healthy choices and thus reducing the overall prevalence and incidence of obesity and related health conditions (hypertension, diabetes type 2, and cardiovascular diseases) within their communities.

This study also determined the degree to which at-risk student characteristics such as socioeconomic status, gender, age, ethnicity, and academic behaviors affected experiences in education2020 as measured by student satisfaction and pace of credit recovery. This study consisted of 220 high school students enrolled in the education2020 online credit recovery program at a small, urban high school district. Students came from three comprehensive high schools and one continuation school. The sample included students who were identified for education2020 due to applicable credit deficiency. A district-initiated survey gathered all demographic information and satisfaction levels. De-identified credit recovery data from one quarter revealed credit recovery patterns of one group of 67 seniors from the original 220-student sample. The survey data was analyzed using a hierarchical linear regression analysis to determine whether any student characteristics predicted satisfaction with education2020. Credit recovery data was examined using anova and Chi-square analyses to determine the relationship between pace of recovery and specific variables such as school site, academic behaviors, age, and ethnicity. The results of this study indicated that no demographic characteristic predicted satisfaction with education2020; the only significant variance was related to school site. There was no significant relationship between demographic characteristics and pace of credit recovery, but there was a positive correlation between academic behaviors such as prior credits earned and pass rate in concurrent face-to-face classes. Because no demographic characteristic prevented or ensured success in e2020, these findings demonstrate equal opportunity for at-risk students to find satisfaction and to recover credits. However, learning environment factors and academic behaviors did, in fact, demonstrate a relationship to satisfaction and pace of credit recovery. This information suggests that further research is needed to examine the specific components of the online learning environment and of programs for at-risk students, as well as their success in concurrent face-to-face classes and ability to recover credits in an online credit recovery program.

It explored how having prior knowledge of one's preferred learning styles and completing online mathematics activities in those preferred learning styles affected learner mathematical achievement and determined what effect those activities had on learners' attitudes toward mathematics and motivational levels. Web-based mathematics activities that differentiated instruction were utilized for 180 sixth-grade middle school mathematics students in a public, rural school in the eastern United States. The instructional activities were used to teach middle school students through hands on, video, audio, numbers, and text to develop higher-order thinking skills while increasing achievement of solving algebraic equations. Entry surveys, Canfield Learning Styles Inventory, pretest, online activities, posttest, extension activities, and exit surveys were documented through a course management system and Web-based survey instruments in order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the results. The data collected and analyzed indicated that on average, learners, regardless of learning styles knowledge, who completed online activities in their preferred learning styles, exhibited higher posttest scores than their corresponding pretest scores. Statistical analysis on participants' attitude levels indicated that completing online activities in their preferred learning styles had no significant effect on their attitude levels. Further statistical tests determined that neither treatment group affected participants' attitudes toward how helpful taking high school math courses would be to them and their attitudes toward their choice of being happier in a math class than in any other class. Analyzing participants' motivational levels found that completing online activities in their preferred learning styles had no significant effect on their motivational levels. Finally, additional statistical tests found that neither treatment group affected participants' motivational levels. Although this study adds a small contribution to the literature, it demonstrates the need for additional research on learning styles involving other grade levels, different mathematical topics, other academic subjects, other geographical regions, and additional interactive tools. Long-term research could track how students' preferred learning styles change from kindergarten through their senior year. Finally, future studies could examine the impact on student achievement if students were assessed in their preferred learning styles.

Although online education has been widely studied, there have been no studies comparing the perceptions of learners enrolled in online with those enrolled in face-to-face learning in a prelicensure nursing program. The purpose of this quantitative study was to compare perceptions of learners enrolled in an online track with perceptions of learners enrolled in a face-to-face track of the same prelicensure nursing education program. Participants included 20 online learners and 59 face-to-face learners in an associate degree nursing (ADN) program of a large community college in Central Texas. All participants either had graduated in December 2010 or were candidates for graduation in May 2011. Participants completed an online survey with 20 Likert-type items to indicate perceptions of didactic content, learner-instructor interaction, and the learning environment. As data did not meet the assumptions for parametric statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to evaluate the ranked differences in the independent variables between the online and face-to-face groups. There were no significant ranked differences for perceptions of didactic content,  p = .76, learner-instructor interaction, p = .30, and learning environment, p = .80. The results were aligned with existing research findings in other areas, according to which the perceived differences between online and face-to-face instruction were not significant. The findings could be used to initiate a dialogue among nurse educators about the value of online prelicensure nursing education programs. Suggestions for future research include qualitative research to elicit more detailed learner responses, correlational studies including demographic factors, evaluations of specific learning styles and experiences with online learning, and studies of factors impeding or facilitating completion. Documentation of perceptions of learners studying other professional disciplines, such as dentistry, medicine, and veterinary medicine, would also be valuable.

Research and professional standards were reviewed yielding agreement that educational leadership is a complex area of study possessing a variety of competencies. Currently in the United States, the Interstate School Leaders Licensure Consortium (ISLLC) Standards are the national benchmark for identifying preferred administrator competencies. The Mid-content Research for Education and Learning's (McREL) Framework of 21 Leadership Characteristics serves as a practitioner's model describing leadership competencies. Research regarding the hiring practices for educational leaders was also explored. This research highlights concern for the lack of a coherent research-based process for identifying the best future leaders and disclosed conflicting information on an administrative shortage. An electronic survey was sent to Missouri school administrators representing both building and central office leadership. The survey requested respondents to rank on a 5 point Likert scale from not important to very important 60 principal interview questions developed for possible inclusion in an Interactive Computer Interview System (ICIS) for Principals. The Interactive Computer Interview System was created by Dr. Howard Ebmeier in conjunction with the American Association of School Personnel Administrators (AASPA) and uses a laptop computer to track responses to interview questions, suggest follow up questions, and create a summary report to capture aspects of the interview. Reliability of the survey instrument, the Principal Interview Question Perception survey, was established through the use of Cronbach's Alpha. The full scale survey instrument was determined reliable with Cronbach's Alpha at .96. Each subscale of the instrument was also deemed to demonstrate internal consistency above the .70 level. ANOVA was used to determine whether administrators at varying levels indicated a differing perception of and preference for the importance of the interview questions. ANOVA was run on the full scale of 60 interview questions and each subscale. Post hoc analysis using the Tukey HSD method further disclosed administrator differences. Results from this study showed that on the full scale and three of the five subscales there was a significant difference among administrator levels on their preference for the interview questions. These results suggest that administrators at varying levels place differing values on administrator competencies disclosed by the interview questions.

The current study evaluated the psychometric properties of this instrument when administered during a series of weekly phone calls. The WPC demonstrated strong psychometric properties throughout the study beginning with intake, and when followed up at 3-months. An exploratory factor analysis yielded two factors consistent with Internalizing and Externalizing constructs. The two scales also demonstrated strong internal consistency at the beginning of treatment and after three months of treatment. Both versions of the WPC also demonstrated good test-retest reliability when phone call data were analyzed for consistency between initial phone call and a second follow-up call approximately one week later. Child and Caregiver scores on the WPC were compared to their scores on the Youth Self-Report (YSR; Achenbach, 2001) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach, 2001). Both forms of the WPC demonstrated convergent validity and the WPC-Caregiver showed significant divergent validity. After 3-months of treatment, symptom scores on the WPC and the YSR/CBCL demonstrated small and moderate effect sizes respectively. When controlling for baseline measurement, scores on the YSR/CBCL were correlated with WPC scores at 3-months. Implications for administration of the instrument are discussed.

In this dissertation, I develop and implement Cognitive Surveyor, a system that enables the automated and precise study of spatial knowledge and navigation practices in everyday environments. Much like the equipment and techniques used by land surveyors, Cognitive Surveyor uses a small mobile computer (a smartphone) with a GPS unit and a digital compass integrated. Each user carries such a device, which tracks their movement. Using the device, people label as landmarks locations they consider meaningful. The device then prompts them to point and estimate the distance toward out-of-sight landmarks. Based on these piecemeal measurements, the system can then produce analyses, both quantitative and qualitative, as well as visualizations. First, I consider the components necessary for the Cognitive Surveyor system and discuss relevant research literature from a variety of fields. I then iteratively develop a usable system in the process of running three behavioral studies. In the first study, participants complete a real-world ""traveling salesman problem,"" in which they must take the shortest possible path to visit a set of destinations in an urban setting. Participants carry and use a Cognitive Surveyor system, which quizzes them on their spatial knowledge for the destinations, as they visit each. This study verifies that the system obtains similar patterns of results to previous lab-based studies and also suggests how different notions of distances may shape people's travel patterns. In the second study, people learn routes using a satellite navigation system and then are forced to re-walk, from memory, the same route, while also carrying a Cognitive Surveyor system, which measures their spatial knowledge. The findings begin to show how the design of navigation systems (and other location-based services) can influence their users' acquisition of spatial knowledge. In the final study, participants use the Cognitive Surveyor application on their own smartphone for a week's time. The results demonstrate how spatial knowledge can be measured in everyday, real-world settings and suggest future uses of Cognitive Surveyor, for both basic and applied research.

My goal was to encourage young people to think about their choices and avoid unsafe risk-taking activities. I felt a gap in my role as mentor to these junior high and high school students; no one was teaching them skills that might assist them in making good choices. Having engaged in spiritual practices for many years, and having a particular interest in newer technologies such as biofeedback, I therefore developed a research question that might provide a useful strategy for youth: How might the development of heart intelligence through the use of biofeedback in a high school setting be facilitated and encouraged? The research topic demanded a theoretical and methodological approach that was sensitive to uncovering and understanding abstract constructs such as heart intelligence and psychophysiological coherence. I blended together integral theory - specifically Wilber's integral model - with Gadamer and Heidegger's hermeneutic ontology/epistemology, and the consequent hermeneutic phenomenological methodology, into an original qualitative explanatory framework that I named –  integral hermeneutic phenomenology. Using in-depth face-to-face interviews, focus group discussions, interactions on Facebook, and conversations via e-mail, I gathered the personal accounts of the evolution and expression of the development of heart intelligence in my 15 participants: students and staff at the school site. I also kept track of participants' experiences of learning to operate biofeedback technology and enter the state of coherence. I then analyzed and interpreted the themes arising from these interactions, so as to compose an integral synthesis of the results for each participant and the group as a whole. The data uncovered eight primary themes: (1) achievement of active relaxation and peaceful state of coherence; (2) connection between coherence and heart-based living and other spiritual practices/interests; (3) glimpses of potential and possibility for health benefits through heart-based living; (4) importance of will or personal motivation in the practice of coherence building; (5) need for guidance and encouragement from peers, teachers and the school culture in order to live more from the heart; (6) effect of developing heart intelligence on relationships with peers, teachers and family; (7) challenges and opportunities with the biofeedback computer technology; (8) influence of the environment on participants' attempts to practice coherence. These themes were situated within the quadrants of the integral model that served to shed light on the personal, interpersonal and societal nature of the data. The data also revealed some important considerations for how best to implement this kind of training in a high school setting. Based on the experiences of the 15 participants, it would appear that biofeedback and the development of heart intelligence can be powerful agents for enabling people to consciously experience the absence of stress, and for supporting those who are motivated in their efforts to live healthier, more balanced and spiritually fulfilling lives. Done properly, this kind of training could assist youth in their struggles towards making good choices and achieving independence. Staff could use the skills personally to deal with the many stresses of being educators, as well as assisting young people in their growth. Potentially, this type of training and focus beyond pure academic content could be a small part of the evolution of educational systems toward a more human-friendly environment.

"RIXAFQ6E","thesis","2012","Wolske, Kimberly S.","Encouraging climate-friendly behaviors through a community energy challenge: The effects of information, feedback, and shared stories","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1269434115?accountid=14026","Research suggests that changes in household behavior can play a significant role in mitigating climate change. While surveys indicate that many Americans care about climate change and believe something should be done to reduce it, a number of real and perceived barriers prevent them from acting on that concern. This research investigated two strategies to promote engagement in climate-friendly behaviors: (1) providing feedback about the positive impact of participants' energy-saving efforts on their carbon footprint; and (2) sharing stories about other participants' conservation successes. A random sample of residents in a Midwest college town were invited to participate in a month-long community Energy Challenge that asked households to try to reduce their carbon footprint by 2 percent. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: monthly feedback, weekly feedback, and weekly feedback + stories. All participants received a booklet that gave procedural guidance and estimated carbon savings for 34 behaviors related to personal transportation, household energy use, and dietary choices. In addition, all participants were asked to track their efforts in an online log. For participants in the weekly feedback conditions, these logs estimated their total carbon savings for each week of the challenge. Weekly e-mails were sent to all groups to encourage completion of the logs. For participants in the weekly feedback + stories condition, these reminders included anecdotes about other participants' conservation experiences. Overall, the results suggest that the basic format of the Energy Challenge provided a supportive setting for developing new climate-friendly behaviors and increasing existing ones. The majority of participants (78 percent), regardless of treatment condition, achieved the Energy Challenge goal, with a median carbon savings of 6 percent. For some participants, weekly feedback helped reduce perceived barriers related to driving less and the perception that conserving requires sacrifice. Participants who had less prior conservation experience as well as those who received weekly feedback were more likely to engage in a broader set of climate-friendly behaviors. Finally, results from a follow-up survey suggest that most participants maintained the behaviors they adopted one month after the Energy Challenge ended.

Research shows that students prefer courses accompanied by online recordings and an increasing number of universities provide recorded lectures. This paper presents the results of a study into the use of recorded lectures at two universities in the Netherlands. The goal of the study is to gain a better understanding of the way that this group of students use recorded lectures. This understanding will enable the creation of usage scenarios that need to be supported. Our results show that students use recorded lectures as a replacement for missed lectures and for study tasks, like preparing for an exam. A large proportion of the students report that they watch 75-100% of a recorded lecture when the view one. The fact that students did not mention the quality of the actual lectures appears not to influence the use of the recorded lectures. Recorded lectures for courses that only use the blackboard are viewed less often. There are also interesting differences in the use of recorded lectures of the different groups of students at the two universities. To increase the credibility and validity of the results, we need a more direct way to measure the use of recorded lectures by students. Methodological triangulation using the log data for the recorded lectures can provide this.

Some have attributed this increased difficulty to peripheral hearing loss, while others suggest that older listeners may perceive listening in noise as difficult and effortful because it requires them to exert more cognitive resources (Desjardins et al., 2009). The purpose of the present study was to directly evaluate the relationship between cognitive function, listening effort and speech recognition for a group of younger and older normal hearing adults, and a group of older adults with hearing impairment, in various types of background noise. A dual-task paradigm was used to objectively evaluate listening effort. The primary task required participants to repeat sentences presented in three different background noise masker conditions (e.g. Two-Talker (TT), Six-Talker (SIX), Speech-Shaped Noise (SSN)). The secondary task was a digital visual pursuit rotor tracking test (DPRT), for which participants were instructed to use a computer mouse to track a moving target around an ellipse that was displayed on a computer screen. Each task was presented separately and concurrently at a fixed speech recognition performance level of 76% correct. In addition, participants' subjectively rated how easy it was to listen to the sentences in each masker condition on a scale from 0 (e.g. very difficult) to 100 (e.g. very easy). Last, participants completed a battery of cognitive tests which measured working memory (Reading Span test), processing speed (DSST) and selective attention (Stroop test) ability. Results revealed that participants' working memory and processing speed ability were significantly related to their speech recognition performance in noise in all three background noise masker conditions. Both groups of older participants expended significantly more listening effort than younger participants in the SSN and TT masker conditions. For each group of participants, there were no significant differences in listening effort measured across the masker conditions, with the exception of the younger participants who expended more effort listening in the SIX masker condition compared to the SSN condition. All participants' listening effort expended on the TT and SSN masker conditions was significantly correlated with their working memory and processing speed performance. Participants' subjective ratings of listening effort did not correlate with their objective measures of listening effort on any of the listening conditions. Findings from the present study indicate that older adults, independent of peripheral hearing loss, require more cognitive resources than younger adults to understand speech in background noise.

However, we often face situations in which the effects of our actions are probabilistic (e.g., returns on our investments), and the environment itself is dynamic,—it can change irrespective of any action we decide to take, and in a relatively stable or unstable way (e.g., economic climate). Therefore, the problem of control concerns learning to isolate the effects that are generated directly by our actions, from those that occur independently of them. We face this problem in a host of uncertain dynamic environments: ecological (using fertilizers to increase crop yield), economic (investing in real estate), industrial (operating nuclear power plants), mechanical (driving cars) and medical (stemming outbreaks of disease). The aim of this review is to bring together empirical research from disparate disciplines spanning Social and Cognitive Psychology as well as Neuroscience all of which are concerned with adaptive control. In order to achieve this, this chapter presents a general framework (Monitoring and control—MC framework) which is used to integrate two central ideas (agency, uncertainty) that have important ramifications for understanding self regulatory processes and their relationship to control processes. In sum, the chapter proposes that control processes involve self-regulatory mechanisms (Task Monitoring and Self Monitoring) that enable us to make subjective estimates of success, which help to anchor our interpretation of uncertain events to expected ones. In addition, these estimates are integrated with estimations of rates of change of the events in the environment which helps us track the outcomes we aim to control. The chapter ends with a discussion on the illusion of control and the possible mechanisms that give rise to it.

"BC35CCAA","thesis","2012","Gao, Yijun","Gauging public interest from server logs, surveys and inlinks a multi-method approach to analyze news websites","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/964202711?accountid=14026","As the World Wide Web (the Web) has turned into a full-fledged medium to disseminate news, it is very important for journalism and information science researchers to investigate how Web users access online news reports and how to interpret such usage patterns. This doctoral thesis collected and analyzed Web server log statistics, online surveys results, online reprints of the top 50 news reports, as well as external inlinks data of a leading comprehensive online newspaper (the  People's Daily Online) in China, one of the biggest Web/information markets in today's world. The aim of the thesis was to explore various methods to gauge the public interest from a Webometrics perspective. A total of 129 days of Web server log statistics, including the top 50 Chinese and English news stories with the highest daily pageview numbers, the comments attracted by these news items and the emailed frequencies of the same stories were collected from October 2007 to September 2008. These top 50 news items' positions on the Chinese and English homepages and the top 50 queries submitted to the website search engine of the People's Daily Online were also retrieved. Results of the two online surveys launched in March 2008 and March 2009 were collected after their respective closing dates. The external inlinks to the People's Daily Online were retrieved by Yahoo! (Chinese and English versions), and the online reprints were retrieved by Google. Besides the general usage patterns identified from the top 50 news stories, this study, by conducting statistical tests on the data sets, also reveals the following findings. First, the editors' choices and the readers' favorites do not always match each other; thus content of news title is more important than its homepage position in attracting online visits. Second, the Chinese and English readers' interests in the same events are different. Third, the pageview numbers and comments posted to the news items reflect the unfavorable attitudes of the Chinese people toward the United States and Japan, which might offer us a method to investigate the public interest in some other issues or nations after necessary modifications. More importantly, some publicly available data, such as the comments posted to the news stories and online survey results, further show that the pageview measure does reflect readers' interests/needs truthfully, as proved by the strong correlations between the top news reports and relevant top queries. The external ininks to the news websites and the online reprints of the top news items help us examine readers' interests from other perspectives, as well as establish online profiles of the news websites. Such publicly accessible information could be an alternative data source for researchers to study readers' interests when the Web server log data are not available. This doctoral thesis not only shows the usefulness of Web server log statistics, survey results, and other publicly accessible data in studying Web user's information needs, but also offers practical suggestions for online news sites to improve their contents and homepage designs. However, no single method can draw a complete picture of the online news readers' interests. The above mentioned research methodologies should be employed together, in order to make more comprehensive conclusions. Future research is especially needed to investigate the continuously rapid growth of the ""Mobile News Readers,"" which poses both challenges and opportunities to the press industry in the 21 st century.

Now, mobilizing neoliberal ideologies, Acadian community leaders and the Canadian federal government are striving to develop the global commodification of Acadian culture, through arts and tourism, as a way to ensure the reproduction of Acadian identity in a global economy. The Acadian art scene, first institutionalized as a space for the protection of Acadian culture and the French language by community organizations and the State, has long been a privileged space for the production and reproduction of nationalist understandings of Acadian culture. The commodification of culture is a site of ideological tensions on questions of nationalism as, simultaneously, increased urbanization and the democratization of the media is challenging the nationalist understanding of Acadian identity, as artists and community organizations claim a space of multilingualism in their work. In this presentation, I will draw on data I collected in a multisited ethnography, to show how the push for commodification is a source of tension for the Acadian community. I track ideologies of language from the government decision-making to the production and circulation of Acadian art, to analyze the tensions Acadian artists and community organizers experience as they try to enter or maintain themselves in the global economy, through the use of web-based media, alterglobalizing networks or government and private sponsorships. I will show how the institutionalization of languages as homogeneous is constraining the field of Acadian art, as actors are deploying diverse strategies to participate within or critique the existing networks.

In particular, interest in entertainment appealing to youth has been the focus of social and legislative changes aimed at protecting youth from increased sexual and violent content associated with comic books, music lyrics, Internet content, and film and television. The intent of this study is to compare the emergence and progression of moral panics related to entertainment appealing to youth, such as comic books, music lyrics, the Internet, and film and television, since 1938 to 2010 to better understand the ways we construct youth in the context of moral panics. Cohen's 1972 model of the progression of moral panics was used to compare reactions to entertainment appealing to youth over a 50-year period of time to determine if they followed similar patterns. Cohen's 1972 model was also used to examine the various ways youth is constructed during moral panics. The model clearly exemplifies that reactions to the entertainment genres examined in the study do follow Cohen's (1972) pattern. Whereas the comic book and music lyrics were easier to track, technology complicated tracking of responses when examining reactions to Internet and film and television. Conclusions are drawn that how youth is constructed in the context of moral panics is closely related to how adulthood and parenthood is constructed. When parenting habits come under scrutiny, it appears that youth are viewed with suspicion as delinquents; on the other hand, when outside issues or events are targeted as problematic, youth are viewed as in need of protection. Thus, the construction of youth in the context of moral panics appears to be as focused on parenthood as it is on childhood or adolescence.

"2ZK3VD23","thesis","2012","Dickens, Ronnie Dean","Five-year trends in 10th grade alternative high school students' reading and mathematics state-mandated test scores, school Adequate Yearly Progress, and dropout rates","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/993099550?accountid=14026","Little research has been conducted on the academic success of alternative high schools. The purpose of this retrospective, longitudinal descriptive study was to determine whether four alternative high schools were successful from 2003 to 2008 in improvement or decline in four variables: students' reading and mathematics scores on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT), school Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP), and student dropout rates. Quantitative research methodology was employed, with frequencies and percentages of gains and declines over the period. The theoretical framework was the viability of alternative schools to help at-risk students develop academic skills and control antisocial behaviors. The first two research questions asked to what extent alternative high school students' FCAT reading and mathematics scores changed. The third question asked whether alternative schools' AYP reports changed, and the fourth question asked whether students' dropout rates changed. Null hypotheses were formulated for all questions. No instruments were necessary; data were collected onsite and through the Internet. The population included all students (534) in four schools of the 16 in one Southeast Florida urban school district. Most students were of low socioeconomic status. In two schools, 50% of students were male and 50% female; in one school all students were male; in another all female. In three schools, the majority of these students were African American; in one the majority of students were Hispanic. All four null hypotheses were rejected. For Hypothesis 1, the FCAT reading scores over the study period declined for three of the four schools, with a small gain for one. For Hypothesis 2, the FCAT mathematics scores increased for three of the four schools, with decline for one. For Hypothesis 3, none of the schools made AYP, although the schools varied in percentages of gains or declines. For Hypothesis 4, dropout rates varied between1.2% to 23.9%; which are below the national average of 33%. This study may be the first to track alternative schools' academic success. Implications include dissemination of findings to educators and administrators at district, county, and state levels. Findings could prompt educators to conduct additional similar studies and seek additional funding to improve educational strategies at alternative schools.

It is of value to understand how coaches perceive their practice. Such information can be utilized to create a common knowledge-base about coaches that can be used, in turn, to track trends and forward research that evaluates coaching services. As the use of Co-Active coaching in facilitating behaviour change continues to rise it becomes important to learn more about Certified-Professional Co-Active Coaches (CPCC). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate what CPCCs enjoy about being coaches. These results were contained within a larger survey. A total of 390 CPCCs who were over 18 years of age, could read English, and had access to the Internet participated in the current study. Findings included: that witnessing clients change their lives; the sense of satisfaction and fulfillment from coaching; the collaborative relationship with clients; the autonomy and flexibility of the profession; and the gratification received from using their skill set were the main reasons CPCCs enjoyed coaching. This paper elaborates on these findings and makes suggestions for future research.

However, it is unclear whether overweight predicts or is predicted by excessive amounts of screen time. The aim of this study was to examine the direction of the association between screen time and body fatness in Dutch adolescents. Methods: Longitudinal data of 465 Dutch adolescents (mean age at baseline 13 years, 53% boys) was used. Body fatness (objectively measured BMI, four skin folds and waist- and hip circumference), self-reported time spent watching TV and computer use, and aerobic fitness (shuttle run test) were assessed in all participants at three time points during 12 months. Multi-level linear autoregressive analyses was used to examine whether screen time predicted body fatness in the following time period and whether body fatness predicted screen time. Analyses were performed for boys and girls separately and adjusted for ethnicity and aerobic fitness. Results: Time spent TV viewing did predict changes in BMI and hip circumference in boys, but not in girls, in the subsequent period. Computer time significantly predicted increases in skinfolds in boys and girls and increases in BMI in girls. Body fatness did not predict any changes in screen time. Conclusion: The present study only partly supports the widely posited hypothesis that higher levels of screen time cause increases in body fatness. In addition, this study demonstrates that high levels of body fatness do not predict increases in screen time.

The purpose of this study was to use social network analysis to understand how the research collaboration network evolved within a productive department. Methods: Over a 13-year period, a departmental faculty completed an annual survey describing their research collaborations. Data were analyzed using social network analysis. Network measures focused on connectedness, distance, groupings and heterogeneity of distribution, while measures for the research director and external collaboration focused on centrality and roles within the network. Longitudinal patterns of network collaboration were assessed using Simulation Investigation for Empirical Network Analysis software (University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands). Results: Based upon the number of active research projects, research development can be divided into three phases. The initial development phase was characterized by increasing centralization and collaboration focused within a single subject area. During the maintenance phase, measures went through cycles, possibly because of changes in faculty composition. While the research director was not a ‘key player’ within the network during the first several years, external collaboration played a central role during all phases. Longitudinal analysis found that forming ties was more likely when the opportunity for network closure existed and when those around you are principal investigators (PIs). Conclusion: Initial development of research relied heavily upon a centralized network involving external collaboration; a central position of the research director during research development was not important. Changes in collaboration depended upon faculty gender and tenure track as well as transitivity and the ‘popularity of PIs’.

The Cancer Institute New South Wales (NSW)’s Tobacco Tracking Survey, a continuous tracking telephone survey of adult smokers and recent quitters, was used to monitor recall of tobacco news and smoking-related cognitions and behaviours from January to September 2010 (approximately 50 interviews per week;  n = 1952). Thirty per cent of respondents reported semi-prompted recall of tobacco news with patterns of recall closely following peaks in news coverage. Television was the most frequently cited source of tobacco news. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that, controlling for individual characteristics, smokers with high levels of tobacco news recall were significantly more likely to have strong beliefs about harms from smoking [odds ratio (OR) = 1.38] and frequent thoughts about quitting (OR 5 1.32). The results show that the news media are an important source of information for smokers, with the potential to influence beliefs and to put or keep quitting on the smokers’ agenda. Media advocacy remains an important component of tobacco control.

Participants completed a problem-solving variant of a memory game that involved 625 distinct states, 24 operators, and an astronomical number of paths through the state space. Three sources of information were used for classification purposes. First, an Imperfect Memory Model was used to estimate transition probabilities for the HMM. Second, behavioral data provided information about the timing of different events. Third, multivoxel pattern analysis of the imaging data was used to identify features of the operators. By combining the three sources of information, an HMM algorithm was able to efficiently identify the most probable path that participants took through the state space, achieving over 80% accuracy. These results support the approach as a general methodology for tracking mental states that occur during individual problem-solving episodes.

Initially, these environments were a little more than document repositories that tutor used unicast to the students. Informed in part by social constructivist theories of education, later environments included capabilities for tutor–student and student–student, synchronous and asynchronous communication. The initial research of this paper reports the typical low usage of these capabilities. The main research attempted to ameliorate this problem by the provision of tools to promote a sense of social awareness as self-presence and copresence, and evaluation techniques to analyse e-learners’ interactions. Data was obtained from prepost questionnaires, log files and social network analysis which augmented the data provided by the tools embedded in Moodle. The results indicate the importance of social awareness in effective e-learning; the quality of active participation can be increased by the use of associated tools.The e-tutor’s role is still pivotal to facilitate and to support such engagement towards collaborative learning. Implications for future research suggest that social awareness tools and evaluation techniques can create awareness cues in an interface with a potential impact on learning.

It is an issue that has raised a great deal of debate in academic circles, with many concerned about what this shift means in terms of the role and purpose of universities, the kinds of research that is valued (or not) and the longer term impact on innovation and thinking. As well as these bigger questions, each field or discipline will have their own perspective on the implications of the impact agenda for their practice, and I would like to highlight some of the significant challenges as well as opportunities that I see for those engaged in research around learning, media and technology. Indeed, the research that readers and contributors to this journal carry out is perhaps a particularly interesting case, as the extent to which our research is rooted in practice varies significantly. As a starting point, it is important to recognize that we all hope to make a difference of some kind, and often do—through our teaching, conversations with colleagues and our research and dissemination—but these 'impacts' are wide-ranging and often subtle, diffuse and difficult to measure. The discourse of impact is very much framed within a strong policy and practice agenda. This may be problematic as it places a value and focus on certain kinds of impact, and may lead to an even greater tendency to frame research in ways that meet with the current policy viewpoints in order to obtain funding. Demonstrating impact also risks the narrowing of methodological techniques, as questions are reduced to a focus on cost effectiveness. In this scenario, technology and media are condensed to a straightforward tool for teaching, with quasi-experimental studies that obsess over whether these new tools are more effective or not compared with 'traditional' methods of learning and teaching. Furthermore, the impact agenda may offer some methodological and conceptual advantages. To measure impact requires the possibility both to measure things over time, and/or have a relatively holistic understanding of the phenomena of interest both in quantitative and qualitative terms. Such approaches could track changes and measure impacts in ways that the current plethora of small-scale studies that characterize our field cannot, and would provide a valuable addition to the typical methodological choices we currently make. As currently conceived, the focus on impact presents a number of concerns for academia as a whole and for our own research. Yet, there is at the same time an opportunity for us to be more reflexive about our work and the impact it makes, to conduct research with a more critical edge and to be more ambitious in the methodological approaches we employ. As editors of  Learning Media and Technology, we will welcome and encourage articles that actively take on the impact agenda and hope this leads to a reframing of the key debates within our field.

Questionnaires were completed by 646 sport officials from eleven sports. They retrospectively estimated the percentage of games in which they heard trash talk, the percentage of players they heard using trash talk, and the types of trash talk they heard. They also indicated how they responded to four different types of trash talk. Reports of trash talk were most common in ice hockey (58% of games) and football (41% of games) and least frequent in volleyball (2%) and track and field (3%). Ice hockey and football officials reported the highest percentages of players using trash talk (23% and 17%), and volleyball, swimming and diving, and track and field reported the lowest percentages (2%). Officials indicated that the most common type of trash talk is demeaning the skill or athleticism of opponents, and demeaning the sexuality or sexual orientation of opponents was the least common type. Officials reported that they were most punitive in their reactions to demeaning trash talk about sexuality/sexual orientation and most lenient in their reactions to trash talk belittling skill/athleticism and courage/toughness. Results support earlier research suggesting that there are normative rules among some athletes favoring the use of trash talk. Further, results from this study suggest that some sport officials may subscribe to normative rules regarding how they respond to trash talk by athletes.

The EAR is a digital audio recorder that runs on a handheld computer and periodically and unobtrusively records snippets of ambient sounds from participants’ momentary environments. In tracking moment-to-moment ambient sounds, it yields acoustic logs of people’s days as they naturally unfold. In sampling only a fraction of the time, it protects participants’ privacy and makes large observational studies feasible. As a naturalistic observation method, it provides an observer’s account of daily life and is optimized for the objective assessment of audible aspects of social environments, behaviors, and interactions (e.g., habitual preferences for social settings, idiosyncratic interaction styles, subtle emotional expressions). This article discusses the EAR method conceptually and methodologically, reviews prior research with it, and identifies three concrete ways in which it can enrich psychosomatic research. Specifically, it can a) calibrate psychosocial effects on health against frequencies of real-world behavior; b) provide ecological observational measures of health-related social processes that are independent of self-report; and c) help with the assessment of subtle and habitual social behaviors that evade self-report but have important health implications. An important avenue for future research lies in merging traditional self-report-based ambulatory monitoring methods with observational approaches such as the EAR to allow for the simultaneous yet methodologically independent assessment of inner, experiential aspects (e.g., loneliness) and outer, observable aspects (e.g., social isolation) of real-world social processes to reveal their unique effects on health.

Handling the occlusion between objects is the key issue in multiple-target tracking. This paper introduces the method of motion segmentation into the object tracking system, and presents a SPA (Skeleton Points Assign, SPA) based occlusion segmentation approach to track multiple people through complex situations captured by static monocular cameras. In the proposed method, we first select the skeleton points and evaluate their occlusion states by low-level information like optical flow; then we assign these points to different objects using advanced semantic information, such as appearance, motion and color; finally, a dense classification of foreground pixels are taken advantages of to accomplish occlusion segmentation and a blob-based compensation strategy is utilized to estimate the missing information of occluded objects. Object tracking is handled by a particle filter-based tracking framework, in which a probabilistic appearance model is used to find the best particle. Experiments are conducted on the public challenging dataset PETS 2009. Results show that this approach can improve the performance of the existing tracking approach and handle dynamic occlusions better.

Lack of efficacious antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems was identified as one of the causes of increasing resistance, due to the lag time between new resistances and alerts to care providers. Several initiatives to track drug resistance evolution have been developed. However, no effective real-time and source-independent antimicrobial resistance monitoring system is available publicly. Objective: To design and implement an architecture that can provide real-time and source-independent antimicrobial resistance monitoring to support transnational resistance surveillance. In particular, we investigated the use of a Semantic Web-based model to foster integration and interoperability of interinstitutional and cross-border microbiology laboratory databases. Methods: Following the agile software development methodology, we derived the main requirements needed for effective antimicrobial resistance monitoring, from which we proposed a decentralized monitoring architecture based on the Semantic Web stack. The architecture uses an ontology-driven approach to promote the integration of a network of sentinel hospitals or laboratories. Local databases are wrapped into semantic data repositories that automatically expose local computing-formalized laboratory information in the Web. A central source mediator, based on local reasoning, coordinates the access to the semantic end points. On the user side, a user-friendly Web interface provides access and graphical visualization to the integrated views. Results: We designed and implemented the online Antimicrobial Resistance Trend Monitoring System (ARTEMIS) in a pilot network of seven European health care institutions sharing 70+ million triples of information about drug resistance and consumption. Evaluation of the computing performance of the mediator demonstrated that, on average, query response time was a few seconds (mean 4.3, SD 0.1×10² seconds). Clinical pertinence assessment showed that resistance trends automatically calculated by ARTEMIS had a strong positive correlation with the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) (ρ = .86,  P < .001) and the Sentinel Surveillance of Antibiotic Resistance in Switzerland (SEARCH) (ρ = .84, P < .001) systems. Furthermore, mean resistance rates extracted by ARTEMIS were not significantly different from those of either EARS-Net (Δ = ±0.130; 95% confidence interval –0 to 0.030; P < .001) or SEARCH (Δ = ±0.042; 95% confidence interval –0.004 to 0.028; P = .004). Conclusions: We introduce a distributed monitoring architecture that can be used to build transnational antimicrobial resistance surveillance networks. Results indicated that the Semantic Web-based approach provided an efficient and reliable solution for development of eHealth architectures that enable online antimicrobial resistance monitoring from heterogeneous data sources. In future, we expect that more health care institutions can join the ARTEMIS network so that it can provide a large European and wider biosurveillance network that can be used to detect emerging bacterial resistance in a multinational context and support public health actions.

Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what ‘research’ means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric.

Few studies, however, have attempted to define how each of these factors may contribute to poorer accuracy of motor performance with aging. The purpose of this study was to examine whether these changes were best explained by speed of task or stimulus-response compatibility. Methods: Twenty-four younger ( M = 19.5; 18–22 years) and older ( M = 72.5; 65–82 years) adults used knee movement to track a computer-generated disc along a computer-generated sinusoidal wave that either moved at 50 or 70 cm=s. Stimulus-response compatibility consisted of leg and disc movement in the same direction and stimulus-response incompatibility consisted of leg and disc movement in the opposite direction. Performance was analyzed using a mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Younger adults performed better than older adults in all conditions. Magnitudes of error between the stimulus-compatible and stimulus-incompatible conditions were greater for the old group compared to the young group. Both of these findings were consistent with the hypotheses. Inconsistent with the hypothesis, speed of task did not contribute to age-related differences in accuracy of motor performance in either cognitive load conditions. Conclusion: Differences in performance could be attributed to age-related changes in selective inhibition. Future research should focus on examining the potential consequences of decreased inhibition among older adults when completing various activities of daily living and what interventions might mitigate these consequences.

The aims of this study were to determine the: (i) reliability of the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) screen time-based sedentary behaviour questionnaire; and (ii) its validity, i.e. the ability of the questionnaire to correctly rank adolescents according to the objectively measured sedentary time. Methods: A total of 183 adolescents (104 females aged 12.5–17.5 years) were involved in the reliability study. Participants completed the HELENA sedentary questionnaire twice (1 week apart). The validity study comprised 2048 (1212 females) adolescents (12.5–17.5 years of age) included in the HELENA cross-sectional study. Questions included television viewing, computer games, console games, Internet for study and non-study reasons and study during week and weekend days. We compared median values of sedentary time, using accelerometers, by tertiles of self-reported sedentary behaviours and their sum (composite sedentary score). Results: Reliability study: κ-values showed a good agreement (> 0.7), except for Internet for study reasons (0.46 weekdays, 0.33 weekend). The questionnaire correctly classified boys’ sedentary time when analysed by specific behaviours and by a composite sedentary score. In girls, median values of objectively measured sedentary time were not different across tertiles of self-reported sedentary behaviours or the composite sedentary score. Conclusion: The HELENA sedentary questionnaire is reliable, yet only correctly classifies objectively measured sedentary time in boys.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2011-30580-002). Our spelling training software recodes words into multisensory representations comprising visual and auditory codes These codes represent information about letters and syllables of a word. An enhanced version, developed for this study, contains an additional phonological code and an improved word selection controller relying on a phoneme-based student model. We investigated the spelling behavior of children by means of learning curves based on log-file data of the previous and the enhanced software version. First, we compared the learning progress of children with dyslexia working either with the previous software ( n = 28) or the adapted version ( n = 37). Second, we investigated the spelling behavior of children with dyslexia ( n = 37) and matched children without dyslexia ( n = 25). To gain deeper insight into which factors are relevant for acquiring spelling skills, we analyzed the influence of cognitive abilities, such as attention functions and verbal memory skills, on the learning behavior. All investigations of the learning process are based on learning curve analyses of the collected log-file data. The results evidenced that those children with dyslexia benefit significantly from the additional phonological cue and the corresponding phoneme-based student model. Actually, children with dyslexia improve their spelling skills to the same extent as children without dyslexia and were able to memorize phoneme to grapheme correspondence when given the correct support and adequate training. In addition, children with low attention functions benefit from the structured learning environment. Generally, our data showed that memory sources are supportive cognitive functions for acquiring spelling skills and for using the information cues of a multi-modal learning environment.

Relative age effects highlight an erroneous process of initial and on-going player assessment, based largely on subjective opinions of game performance. A more objective assessment of each player’s progress by measuring essential skills during practice is warranted to guide and improve coaching and assessment of talented children. Purpose: To measure the effects of the coaching intervention on performance and learning during a group technical practice. A second purpose was to repeatedly measure each player’s passing, first touch and an awareness response and to measure the reliability of peer assessment as an immediate source of objective feedback. Setting: Weekly coaching sessions at an English professional soccer club academy. A total of 22 practices occurred during the second half of a soccer season. Participants: Academy boys aged 10–12 years, with five players participating throughout the study. The coach was a European ‘A’ licence holder and an experienced physical education teacher. Intervention: The coach and players defined the practice requirements and how to perform each skill successfully. Players were taught to observe, assess and record the performance of their peers. After the practice, players charted their objective scores and bonus game play was awarded based on self-set goal attainment. Research design: A single-subject, multiple-baseline experiment was used to assess the effects of the intervention on performance of the three skills and the reliability of the performance measures. The design and intervention enabled the repeated measurement of all players’ performance and learning during each phase and condition of the experiment. Data collection and analysis: Baseline data were collected from video recording of practice and intervention data were collected from recording and live by a player and the coach. Percent correct scores for each skill were plotted on graphs for visual analysis. Agreements between live and primary video data were calculated to evaluate the reliability of peer-assessed scores. Findings: The intervention was shown to improve the level and consistency of performance in all five participants, which, for most players and skills, was maintained when the intervention was removed. Players were willing and able to reliably assess their peers and collect objective data on each player’s performance. They enjoyed receiving and charting their scores and reported a greater confidence in these skills in competitive situations. Conclusions: The findings suggest this formal accountability, feedback and reinforcement procedure provides a promising method to maximise practice and learning and accurately assess the progress of talented youth soccer players. Further research is recommended to examine the congruent validity of performance measures from more complex learning tasks to discriminate talent and tackle relative age effects. Implications for future talent development coaching and coach education include the potential for repeatable and measurable systems (a technology) to track performance and learning during coaching–practice to help develop and determine the most able children.

Yet the effectiveness of such an approach is highly dependent upon whether the target population has both access and the skill set required to use this technology. This is particularly relevant in the delivery of hearing health care because most people with hearing loss are over 50 years (average age for initial hearing aid fitting is 74 years). Although PC skill and Internet use by demographic factors have been examined previously, data do not currently exist that examine the effects of hearing difficulties on PC skill or Internet use in older adults. Objective: To explore the effect that hearing difficulty has on PC skill and Internet use in an opportunistic sample of adults aged 50-74 years. Methods: Postal questionnaires about hearing difficulty, PC skill, and Internet use (n = 3629) were distributed to adults aged 50-74 years through three family physician practices in Nottingham, United Kingdom. A subsample of 84 respondents completed a second detailed questionnaire on confidence in using a keyboard, mouse, and track pad. Summed scores were termed the “PC confidence index.” The PC confidence index was used to verify the PC skill categories in the postal questionnaire (ie, never used a computer, beginner, and competent). Results: The postal questionnaire response rate was 36.78% (1298/3529) and 95.15% (1235/1298) of these contained complete information. There was a significant between-category difference for PC skill by PC confidence index ( P < .001), thus verifying the three-category PC skill scale. PC and Internet use was greater in the younger respondents (50-62 years) than in the older respondents (63-74 years). The younger group’s PC and Internet use was 81.0% and 60.9%, respectively; the older group’s PC and Internet use was 54.0% and 29.8%, respectively. Those with slight hearing difficulties in the older group had significantly greater odds of PC use compared to those with no hearing difficulties (odds ratio [OR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-2.30, P = .02). Those with moderate+ hearing difficulties had lower odds of PC use compared with those with no hearing difficulties, both overall (OR=0.58, 95% CI 0.39-0.87, P = .008) and in the younger group (OR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.26-0.86, P = .008). Similar results were demonstrated for Internet use by age group (older: OR = 1.57, 95% CI 0.99-2.47, P = .05; younger: OR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.16-0.62, P = .001). Conclusions: Hearing health care is of particular relevance to older adults because of the prevalence of age-related hearing loss. Our data show that older adults experiencing slight hearing difficulty have increased odds of greater PC skill and Internet use than those reporting no difficulty. These findings suggest that PC and Internet delivery of hearing screening, information, and intervention is feasible for people between 50-74 years who have hearing loss, but who would not typically present to an audiologist.

My group agreements state that patients will use their relationships in the group therapeutically, not socially. When I brought up that Sylvia had invited me to friend her in group that week, another group member said, ""What's the big deal? We have all friended each other on Facebook."" This was the first I had heard of the group being in outside contact this way. It turns out they have shared photos of each other's families and often write each other during the week. I wonder how this affects the transference and the group dynamics. Group members not only can look me up, but they can look each other up (last names or revealing occupational clues slip out at times), which also may compromise confidentiality. Yet, a number of my colleagues are using LinkedIn and Facebook to promote their practices. If I don't use social media, will I be left in the dust? If I do, will I feel exposed and vulnerable? And, what is good clinical practice with regard to social media and the Internet? The consultant's answer to this situation is as follows: First, it seems, that you do not currently have a Social Media and Communication Policy but rather you are dealing with issues as they come up. This is confusing for you and your patients. So; as an initial step, the author recommend you create such a policy to include along with your standard informed consent process. What should go into such a document? Well, in part this depends on your theoretical orientation and the ethical guidelines stated by your professional discipline. Texting is similarly problematic in regard to security plus it can be a pain to keep track of and respond to multiple texts. Feel free to limit communication to email and phone or just phone. Specifying this in your Social Media and Communication policy along with the confidentiality rationale will be helpful to you and to your patients. Along with our ability to communicate instantly, there is the expectation that, a response should be instantaneous also.

This is the question this research aims to answer using model-based collaborative techniques and a robotic team—FC Portugal—as a case study. After developing a framework capable of automatically calculating the final game statistics through the RoboCup log files, a feature selection algorithm was used to select the variables that most influence the final game result. In the next stage, given the statistics of the current game, we rank the strategies that obtained the maximum average of goal difference in similar past games. This is done by splitting offline past games into different k-clusters. Then, for each cluster, the expected best strategy was assigned. The online phase consists in the selection of the expected best strategy for the cluster in which the current game best fits. Regarding the final results, our approach proved that it is possible to improve the performance of a robotic team by more than 35%, even in a competitive environment such as the RoboCup 2D simulation league.

It represents an expanded and updated version of the first author’s unpublished dissertation research (Blummer, 2012). The use of the think-aloud protocol facilitated an understanding of individuals’ strategies and perceptions as they searched for information to solve a problem. A variety of quantitative data offered evidence of the impact of the tutorial on students’ problem-solving abilities. The study focused on individuals’ use of specific idea tactics and especially the differences in their problem-solving efforts executed before and after exposure to the tutorial. The study centers on the first author’s unpublished dissertation research that examined the impact of metacognition on education graduate students’ information search. Chapters 3–5, 8–10, and 15–17 focus on the metacognitive aspect of information search. Education students’ information-seeking skills are highlighted in chapters 6 and 7. Information on the research study is offered in chapters 1 and 10–18. The book is organized in two parts. The first half of the book discusses the literature on the main themes in the research study, and these encompassed information search, metacognition, problem solving, metacognitive scaffolds, and education graduate students’ information-seeking behavior. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the study. Chapter 2 presents a review of the literature on information research and online search. Chapter 3 defines metacognition and traces its development. Chapter 4 examines the role of metacognition in problem solving. Chapter 5 considers the impact of metacognition on information problem solving. Chapters 6 and 7 explore education graduate students’ information seeking and information problem-solving skills respectively. Chapter 8 focuses on the role of metacognition in online search. Chapter 9 traces the literature on metacognitive scaffolds. The second half of the book centers on the research study and its findings. Chapter 10 describes the development of the idea tactics tutorial. Chapters 11 and 12 discuss the research methodology, including the problem-solving activity and post-activity interview and the data analysis respectively. Chapter 13 tracks the impact of the Indexes on six participants’ problem solving. Chapter 14 provides the findings in relation to the research questions for these six participants. Chapters 15, 16, and 17 discuss the themes that emerged from the study, including: idea generation and mental pattern breaking, participants’ adoption of metacognitive strategies and behaviors, as well as the incorporation of metacognitive strategies in information literacy instruction. Chapter 18 offers suggestions on utilizing the tutorial to maximize its effectiveness and modifying it for different user groups. The last chapter, 19, provides the conclusion and recommendations for future research.

In this paper we exploit the wealth of user-generated data, available through the micro-blogging service Twitter, to estimate and track the incidence of health conditions in society. The method is based on two stages: we start by extracting possibly relevant tweets using a set of specially crafted regular expressions, and then classify these initial messages using machine learning methods. Furthermore, we selected relevant features to improve the results and the execution times. To test the method, we considered four health states or conditions, namely flu, depression, pregnancy and eating disorders, and two locations, Portugal and Spain. We present the results obtained and demonstrate that the detection results and the performance of the method are improved after feature selection. The results are promising, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.7 and 0.9, and f-measure values around 0.8 and 0.9. This fact indicates that such approach provides a feasible solution for measuring and tracking the evolution of health states within the society.

However, the consequences of such changes on the distribution of an ego’s network ties are not well understood. Here we use a unique 18-mo dataset that combines mobile phone calls and survey data to track changes in the ego networks and communication patterns of students making the transition from school to university or work. Our analysis reveals that individuals display a distinctive and robust social signature, captured by how interactions are distributed across different alters. Notably, for a given ego, these social signatures tend to persist over time, despite considerable turnover in the identity of alters in the ego network. Thus, as new network members are added, some old network members either are replaced or receive fewer calls, preserving the overall distribution of calls across network members. This is likely to reflect the consequences of finite resources such as the time available for communication, the cognitive and emotional effort required to sustain close relationships, and the ability to make emotional investments.

Such interventions should ensure that adolescents establish healthy weight regulation practices while also reducing eating disorder risk. Objective: This study describes an online program, StayingFit, which has two tracks for universal and targeted delivery and was designed to enhance healthy living skills, encourage healthy weight regulation, and improve weight/shape concerns among high school adolescents. Methods: Ninth grade students in two high schools in the San Francisco Bay area and in St Louis were invited to participate. Students who were overweight (body mass index [BMI] > 85th percentile) were offered the weight management track of StayingFit; students who were normal weight were offered the healthy habits track. The 12-session program included a monitored discussion group and interactive self-monitoring logs. Measures completed pre- and post-intervention included self-report height and weight, used to calculate BMI percentile for age and sex and standardized BMI (zBMI), Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) nutrition data, the Weight Concerns Scale, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Results: A total of 336 students provided informed consent and were included in the analyses. The racial breakdown of the sample was as follows: 46.7% (157/336) multiracial/other, 31.0% (104/336) Caucasian, 16.7% (56/336) African American, and 5.7% (19/336) did not specify; 43.5% (146/336) of students identified as Hispanic/Latino. BMI percentile and zBMI significantly decreased among students in the weight management track. BMI percentile and zBMI did not significantly change among students in the healthy habits track, demonstrating that these students maintained their weight. Weight/shape concerns significantly decreased among participants in both tracks who had elevated weight/shape concerns at baseline. Fruit and vegetable consumption increased for both tracks. Physical activity increased among participants in the weight management track, while soda consumption and television time decreased. Conclusions: Results suggest that an Internet-based, universally delivered, targeted intervention may support healthy weight regulation, improve weight/shape concerns among participants with eating disorders risk, and increase physical activity in high school students. Tailored content and interactive features to encourage behavior change may lead to sustainable improvements in adolescent health.

Providing intervention materials via the internet would have the potential to reach more families but may increase sedentary behavior. The purpose was to evaluate whether delivering the AOM Family Intervention via the internet versus printed workbook would have a similar impact on sedentary behaviors in children. Methods: 131 children (age 8–12) were randomized to receive the AOM Family Intervention via the internet or workbook for 12 weeks. Changes in objectively measured sedentary time and moderate-to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as well as self-reported screen time were compared between groups. Results: There were no significant differences between groups in screen time, sedentary time, or MVPA at the end of the 12 week intervention. Families receiving the intervention via the internet were more likely to remain in the study (98% vs. 82%,  P = .016). Conclusions: Using the internet to deliver the lifestyle intervention did not increase sedentary behavior in children. Attrition rates were lower when the program was delivered by internet versus via printed materials. These results provide support for using the internet to deliver healthy lifestyle programs for children.

In the present paper we apply a method recently proposed by other social scientists to three different scenarios, by analyzing on one side the online popularity of Italian political leaders throughout 2011, and on the other the voting intention of French Internet users in both the 2012 presidential ballot and the subsequent legislative election. While Internet users are not necessarily representative of the whole population of a country’s citizens, our analysis shows a remarkable ability for social media to forecast electoral results, as well as a noteworthy correlation between social media and the results of traditional mass surveys. We also illustrate that the predictive ability of social media analysis strengthens as the number of citizens expressing their opinion online increases, provided that the citizens act consistently on these opinions.

Methods: A challenge that entailed completing a core-strengthening exercise using a hashtag (#PlankADay) was circulated via Twitter. This study surveyed users who joined during the first 2 months of the challenge to describe their characteristics, including social support for exercise and to what extent they invited others to join. The study continued to track total users for 10 months. Results: Of 407 individuals who joined in the first 2 months, 105 completed surveys. Among these, 81% were female and 86% white and mean age was 35.8. 72% participated for at least 1 month and 47% participated for at least 2 months. Survey participants reported that the challenge increased their enjoyment of abdominal exercise. Of the 68% of participants who invited others to participate, 28% recruited none, 66% recruited 1–5 users, and 6% recruited 10 or more users. Participants reported that online friends provided as much positive social support for exercise as family and in-person friends. In 14 months, 4941 users produced 76,746 tweets and mean total tweets per user was 15.86 (SD = 75.34; range = 1–2888).

Many improvements are still needed in assessment tools and methodologies, for example, to increase scalable, minimize obtrusiveness, and for developing more powerful analysis routines, to name a few. However, once available, this new way of collecting social interaction data will bring a paradigm shift in social behavioral research that currently relies mostly on self-reported time-dispersed surveys. The new collection of data will be more ecologically valid and free from subjective bias and recall errors. Once algorithms are developed in research settings, the data processing can be completed without compromising the privacy of participants. The shift in how we measure interactions could lead to early detection of cognitive impairment and dementia by providing measurements sensitive to changes in cognitive as well as social function. Potential approaches to be used in behavioral clinical trials have also been widened significantly: web cams, smart phones, Internet/PCs, and in home monitoring could be used to enhance social interaction detection and also track their improvement or change over time. A next set of challenges would be to inform this research by the end users - the older or aging population in naturalistic settings.

Most studies rely on generalized self-reports following engagement in the natural environment. The actual in-situ experience  during contact with nature, and the environmental features and factors that evoke health benefits have remained relatively unexplored. Smartphones offer a new opportunity to monitor and interact with human subjects during everyday life using techniques such as Experience Sampling Methods (ESM) that involve repeated self-reports of experiences as they occur in-situ. Additionally, embedded sensors in smartphones such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and accelerometers can accurately trace human activities. This paper explores how these techniques can be combined to comprehensively explore the perceived health and well-being impacts of contact with nature. Custom software was developed to passively track GPS and accelerometer data, and actively prompt subjects to complete an ESM survey at regular intervals throughout their visit to a provincial park in Ontario, Canada. The ESM survey includes nine scale questions concerning moods and emotions, followed by a series of open-ended experiential questions that subjects provide recorded audio responses to. Pilot test results are used to illustrate the nature, quantity and quality of data obtained. Participant activities were clearly evident from GPS maps, including especially walking, cycling and sedate activities. From the ESM surveys, participants reported an average of 25 words per question, taking an average of 15 s to record them. Further qualitative analysis revealed that participants were willing to provide considerable insights into their experiences and perceived health impacts. The combination of passive and interactive techniques is sure to make larger studies of this type more affordable and less burdensome in the future, further enhancing the ability to understand how contact with nature enhances health and well-being.

The purpose of the current study was to explore the effects of contextual cues of violence in an active videogame on (1) state hostility, (2) perceived arousal, (3) game enjoyment, (4) perceived effort in the game, and (5) activity intensity in the game. Materials and Methods: A one-factor between-subjects experiment with three conditions (minimal, moderate, and extreme contextual cues of violence) of playing an in-house–developed active videogame was conducted. Activity intensity was objectively measured using the ActiGraph (Pensacola, FL) model GT3X accelerometer. Psychological outcomes were measured using established scales. Results: We did not find that the level of contextual cues of violence had any effect on the outcome variables, although the moderate level of contextual cues of violence resulted in a greater amount of feeling mean ( P = 0.011) and unsociable ( P = 0.038) among the players immediately after gameplay than players in the minimal contextual cues of violence condition. We did not find any statistically significant difference among the three conditions in terms of enjoyment, perceived arousal, or activity intensity. Conclusions: This study empirically examined the effects of contextual cues of violence in active videogames on player hostility, arousal, and enjoyment after gameplay as well as their physical activity intensity during gameplay. These findings provide some initial evidence to guide active videogame designers and researchers on how to design the games to be more engaging and thus elicit more activities among the players.

In 2004, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment implemented a population-based intervention in 9 counties, including provider training and a public media campaign, to encourage pregnant women to gain an adequate amount of weight in pregnancy as defined by the 1990 Institute of Medicine guidelines. Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System survey data were used to track weight gain in pregnancy in 1997 through 2004 (baseline), 2005 (post-intervention), and 2006 and 2007 (after the intervention had concluded). During the period immediately after the implementation of the intervention, the percentage of women delivering in the 9 study counties who gained an inadequate amount of weight during pregnancy dropped from 18.4 at baseline to 12.8 in 2005. However, this progress was reversed in 2006, when the percentage of women with inadequate weight gain rose to 19.7. Training providers to educate women about the importance of adequate weight gain in pregnancy, in conjunction with a social marketing campaign, appears to be a promising approach to addressing a major contributor to low birth weight. However, a time-limited intervention is likely to have temporary results.

(see record 2014-22392-014). Gallegos-Ayala et al. reported the use of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in a 67-year-old woman with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who had been completely locked in for more than 2 years. Her evoked potential EEG based on auditory mismatch and oddball presentations supported the presence of cortical processing, but an EEG-based brain–computer interface (BCI) system was not successful. This report should resonate with both BCI research and ALS clinical care. Particularly in light of those sessions where 100% accuracy was achieved, Gallegos-Ayala et al. provide new evidence that consciousness and cognition may indeed survive extended periods of total LIS. Whether this finding evokes hope, fear, introspection, or some combination of these, for the neurologist guiding people with ALS and their families, this report underscores the critical importance of discussions regarding preferences for life-sustaining care through the progression of neuromuscular disease. BCI research is on track to create vital new opportunities for people with LIS. The current report suggests that NIRS might provide the basis for a home-based communication system, permitting serial selection of letters or choices every 25 seconds. It may also be possible that early exposure to BCIs would permit the user to learn better strategies for faster and more accurate neural control of external devices, even as motor power declines.

With noted disparities across racial and social groups in chronic health outcomes, such as cancer, obesity, and diabetes, it is essential that researchers examine any differences in the implementation, uptake, and impact of eHealth strategies across groups that bear a disproportionate burden of disease. Objective: The goal was to examine eHealth use by sociodemographic factors, such as race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), age, and sex. Methods: We drew data from National Cancer Institute’s 2012 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) (N = 3959) which is publicly available online. We estimated multivariable logistic regression models to assess sociodemographic predictors of eHealth use among adult Internet users (N = 2358) across 3 health communication domains (health care, health information–seeking, and user-generated content/sharing). Results: Among online adults, we saw no evidence of a digital use divide by race/ethnicity. However, there were significant differences in use by SES, particularly for health care and health information–seeking items. Patients with lower levels of education had significantly lower odds of going online to look for a health care provider (high school or less: OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.33-0.76) using email or the Internet to communicate with a doctor (high school or less: OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29-0.72), tracking their personal health information online (high school or less: OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32-0.84), using a website to help track diet, weight, and physical activity (high school or less: OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.98; some college: OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.93), or downloading health information to a mobile device (some college: OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33-0.89). Being female was a consistent predictor of eHealth use across health care and user-generated content/sharing domains, whereas age was primarily influential for health information–seeking. Conclusions: This study illustrates that lower SES, older, and male online US adults were less likely to engage in a number of eHealth activities compared to their counterparts. Future studies should assess issues of health literacy and eHealth literacy and their influence on eHealth engagement across social groups. Clinical care and public health communication efforts attempting to leverage Web 2.0 and 3.0 platforms should acknowledge differential eHealth usage to better address communication inequalities and persistent disparities in health.

Campaign awareness is the most frequently reported, short-term comparable measure of campaign effectiveness. Most mass media campaigns report those who were aware with those who are unaware of campaigns. Few campaigns follow awareness in the same respondent, over time, during a mass media campaign to track different patterns of awareness or awareness profiles—“never,” “early,” “late,” or “always”—that may emerge. Using awareness profiles, the authors (a) address any demographic differences between groups and (b) assess changes in physical activity. Find Thirty every day® was a populationwide mass media campaign delivered in Western Australia. The cohort comprised 405 participants, who completed periodic telephone interviews over 2 years. Almost one third (30.4%) were “never aware” of the campaign. More than one third recalled the campaign at one or more time points—“early aware.” Ten percent became aware at Time 2 and stayed aware of the campaign across the remaining time. Examining within and across the awareness profiles, only gender was significant. This article provides an approach to profiling awareness, whereby people cycle in and out and few people are “always aware” over a 2-year period. It presents possible implications and considerations for future campaign planners interested in establishing and maintaining campaign awareness with adult populations.

Objective: Our goal was to compare the longitudinal accuracy of self-reported weights entered online during the course of a randomized weight loss trial to measurements taken in the clinic. We aimed to determine if accuracy of self-reported weight is associated with weight loss and to determine the extent of misclassification in achieving 5% weight loss when using self-reported compared to clinic weights. Methods: This study examined the accuracy of self-reported weights recorded online among intervention participants in the Hopkins Practice-Based Opportunities for Weight Reduction (POWER) trial, a randomized trial examining the effectiveness of two lifestyle-based weight loss interventions compared to a control group among obese adult patients with at least one cardiovascular risk factor. One treatment group was offered telephonic coaching and the other group was offered in-person individual coaching and group sessions. All intervention participants (n = 277) received a digital scale and were asked to track their weight weekly on a study website. Research staff used a standard protocol to measure weight in the clinic. Differences (self-reported weight—clinic weight) indicate if self-report under (-) or over (+) estimated clinic weight using the self-reported weight that was closest in time to the clinic weight and was within a window ranging from the day of the clinic visit to 7 days before the 6-month (n = 225) and 24-month (n = 191) clinic visits. The absolute value of the differences (absolute difference) describes the overall accuracy. Results: Underestimation of self-reported weights increased significantly from 6 months (mean -0.5kg, SD 1.0kg) to 24 months (mean -1.1kg, SD 2.0kg;  P = .002). The average absolute difference also increased from 6 months (mean 0.7kg, SD 0.8kg) to 24 months (mean 1.3, SD 1.8kg; P < .001). Participants who achieved the study weight loss goal at 24 months (based on clinic weights) had lower absolute differences ( P = .01) compared to those who did not meet this goal. At 24 months, there was 9% misclassification of weight loss goal success when using self-reported weight compared to clinic weight as an outcome. At 24 months, those with self-reported weights (n = 191) had three times the weight loss compared to those (n = 73) without self-reported weights ( P < .001). Conclusions: Underestimation of weight increased over time and was associated with less weight loss. In addition to intervention adherence, weight loss programs should emphasize accuracy in self-reporting.

This study examined how objectively measured and self-reported physical activity and sedentary behavior are associated with cognitive functions in school-aged children. The study population consisted of 224 children from five schools in the Jyväskylä school district in Finland (mean age 12.2 years; 56% girls), who participated in the study in the spring of 2011. Physical activity and sedentary time were measured objectively for seven consecutive days using the ActiGraph GT1M/GT3X accelerometer. Self-reported moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and screen time were evaluated with the questions used in the ""WHO Health Behavior in School-aged Children"" study. Cognitive functions including visual memory, executive functions and attention were evaluated with a computerized Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery by using five different tests. Structural equation modeling was applied to examine how objectively measured and self-reported MVPA and sedentary behavior were associated with cognitive functions. High levels of objectively measured MVPA were associated with good performance in the reaction time test. High levels of objectively measured sedentary time were associated with good performance in the sustained attention test. Objectively measured MVPA and sedentary time were not associated with other measures of cognitive functions. High amount of self-reported computer/video game play was associated with weaker performance in working memory test, whereas high amount of computer use was associated with weaker performance in test measuring shifting and flexibility of attention. Self-reported physical activity and total screen time were not associated with any measures of cognitive functions. The results of the present study propose that physical activity may benefit attentional processes.

Method: The authors introduced three phases of change to instruction in literature searching and sourcing for beginning medical students writing learning issue essays: in phase 1 (2003–2006), students were introduced to online resources during orientation week and received a lecture on high-yield literature searching midway through their first curricular block; in phase 2 (2007–2008), the high-yield lecture shifted to orientation week, and a resource matrix and librarian-guided workshop on locating authoritative sources were added; and in phase 3 (2009), peer evaluation and collaboration were implemented. To track changes in sourcing skills, the authors analyzed 3,199 references from 665 essays written by 465 first-year students for two problem-based learning (PBL) cases during the first block of one representative year per phase (2006, 2008, 2009). Results: Over the study period, the authors found significantly increased citations to peer-reviewed journal articles and guidelines and decreased citations to general public Web sites and highly abstracted resources. Peer feedback and collaboration in phase 3 were associated with maintenance of these gains. Conclusions: Early introduction of instruction on medical literature searching and sourcing, a librarian-guided workshop, and peer collaboration and feedback improved the quality of references cited by students in PBL essays during their first curricular block.

On the basis of a student sample of 9th-graders (N = 299), including a representative number of immigrant students (N = 127), the present study evaluated (a) whether CPS can be assessed fairly among students with or without immigration background and (b) whether achievement differences between these groups exist. Results showed that fair assessment of CPS is possible using the Genetics Lab, a computer-based microworld that incorporates game-like characteristics and multilingual-friendly features. Immigrant students were generally outperformed by their nonimmigrant peers, but performance differences can largely be explained by differential enrollment in lower academic tracks. Interestingly, CPS scales were less affected by students’ educational background than a traditional paper-pencil-based reasoning scale. Moreover, a fine-grained analysis of different facets of CPS showed that irrespective of the academic track, immigrant students demonstrated a more efficient task exploration behavior than their native peers (d = 0.26). In sum, this might point to the potential of computer-based assessment of CPS to identify otherwise hidden cognitive potential in immigrant students.

Research on stalking and cyberstalking behaviours address criminal activities that incite fear in a target (e.g., Spitzberg & Cupach, 2007). Little is known about more general post-relationship contact and tracking (PRCT), that is, efforts to maintain or re-establish contact with an ex-partner or to track their whereabouts, new partnerships or activities. To understand both the use and experience of PRCT, we examined reports from 271 Canadian emerging adults (aged 18–25) regarding their most recent breakup within the prior year. Results indicated that online and offline forms of post-relationship contact and tracking were common, characterizing 87.8% of all recent breakups, and were typically used in conjunction. In fact, online forms rarely occurred in isolation. Attempts to keep in contact were most commonly reported by users and targets of behaviours, whereas extreme and threatening behaviours that might comprise stalking or cyberstalking were rare. No gender differences were found in the use of PRCT behaviours, although women reported experiencing more offline forms.

Knowledge on modifiable risk factors is needed to design effective intervention programs. This study aimed to assess associations of children’s sedentary behaviors (television viewing and computer game use) and physical activity behaviors (sports participation, outdoor play, and active transport to/from school) with three indicators of body fat, i.e., percent fat mass, body mass index (BMI) standard deviation scores, and weight status (normal weight, overweight). Methods: Cross-sectional data from 5913 6-year-old ethnically diverse children were analyzed. Children’s weight and height were objectively measured and converted to BMI. Weight status was defined according to age- and sex-specific cut-off points of the International Obesity Task Force. BMI standard deviation scores were created, based on Dutch reference growth curves. Fat mass was measured my dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Sedentary and physical activity behaviors were assessed by parent-reported questionnaires. Series of logistic and linear regression analyses were performed, controlling for confounders (i.e., socio-demographic factors, family lifestyle factors, and other sedentary behaviors and physical activity behaviors). Results: Sports participation was inversely associated with fat mass (p < 0.001), even after adjustment for socio-demographic factors, family lifestyle factors, and other sedentary behaviors and physical activity behaviors. No other independent associations were observed. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that sports participation is inversely associated with percent body fat among ethnically diverse 6-year-old children. More research in varied populations including objective measurements and longitudinal designs are needed to confirm these current results.

The overall study (Swelogs) comprises three tracks of data collection; one epidemiological, one in‐depth and one follow‐up. It is expected to provide information that will inform the development of evidence‐based methods and strategies to prevent the development of gambling problems. This paper gives an overview of the design of the epidemiological track, especially of its two first waves. The baseline wave, performed between October 2008 and August 2009, included 8165 subjects, of whom 6021 were re‐assessed one year later. A stratified random sampling procedure was applied. Computer‐supported telephone interviews were used as the primary method. Postal questionnaires were used to follow‐up those not reached by telephone. The response rate was 55% in the first wave and 74% in the second. The interview and questionnaire data are supplemented by register data.

Given the idiosyncratic nature of desire, and the lack of a “one size fits all” model approach to address desire concerns, it is useful to understand more about the range of ways that women and their partners modulate sexual desire. Aim: This study aims to assess women's strategies to influence their sexual desire and the self‐reported effectiveness of these strategies. Methods: One hundred seventy‐nine women who had been in a relationship with a male partner for 5+ years completed an anonymous Internet‐based survey. Main Outcome Measures: Participants responded to three open‐ended items about the strategies they use to address desire issues and how helpful those strategies are. Results: The most common responses regarding what participants did to get desire back on track included: communication, trying to meet partner's needs, having sex without desire, and having patience/letting time work out the problem. Women also mentioned several specific strategies they had employed: communication, scheduling sex, lingerie, and a date night. However, a large number of women discussed that the issue was not resolved, and they were dissatisfied with attempted strategies. Conclusions: This research provides valuable insight into the construction of women's sexual desire and the strategies used to navigate sexual desire in long‐term relationships.

Design: The study employed a cross-sectional design, assessing physical activity using accelerometers. Method: 105 male youth sport footballers ( M age = 12.79 ± 1.85 years) wore a GT3X accelerometer for 7 days. Measures of height and weight were recorded. Participants completed a multi-section questionnaire assessing perceptions of autonomy support and controlling coaching behaviours, and motivation toward their participation in sport and physically active games. Results: Path analysis supported a model in which players’ perceptions of coach-provided autonomy support positively predicted autonomous motivation for sport engagement. In turn, autonomous motivation was positively associated with MVPA, and negatively related to ST (min/day). Controlling coach behaviours were positively linked to controlled motivation. However, controlled motivation for sport and physically active games was unrelated to daily MVPA and ST. Perceptions of coach-provided autonomy support had a significant positive indirect effect on daily MVPA, and a significant negative indirect effect on daily ST. Conclusions: Results suggest that autonomy supportive coach behaviours are related to daily physical activity patterns in young male footballers. Theory-based interventions that aim to encourage autonomy supportive coaching, and subsequently foster autonomous reasons for sport engagement, may enhance the potential of youth sport for increasing daily MVPA and reducing ST among children and adolescents active in this setting (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)","2014-09","2020-06-05 21:21:37","2020-06-05 21:21:37","","453-463","","5","15","","","","","","","","","","English","","","APA PsycInfo®","1699505017; 2014-29624-004","","","Publisher: Elsevier Science","","","http://library.stanford.edu/sfx?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Apsycinfo&atitle=Coach+autonomy+support+predicts+autonomous+motivation+and+daily+moderate-to-vigorous+physical+activity+and+sedentary+time+in+youth+sport+participants&title=Psychology+of+Sport+and+Exercise&issn=14690292&date=2014-09-01&volume=15&issue=5&spage=453&au=Fenton%2C+Sally+A.+M.%3BDuda%2C+Joan+L.%3BQuested%2C+Eleanor%3BBarrett%2C+Timothy&isbn=&jtitle=Psychology+of+Sport+and+Exercise&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/2014-29624-004&rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.psychsport.2014.04.005","Male; Motivation; article; Body Weight; Autonomy; United Kingdom; Exercise; Human; Coaching; Empirical Study; MVPA; Sports; Accelerometer; Self-determination theory; Quantitative Study; Adolescence (13-17 yrs); Childhood (birth-12 yrs); School Age (6-12 yrs); 3720:Sports; Coaches; Sedentary time; Youth sport","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One explanation may be differential use of non-assigned cessation treatments—including other Internet programs—that either amplify or mask study intervention effects. We examined the impact of non-assigned treatment use on cessation outcomes in The iQUITT Study, a randomized trial of Internet and telephone treatment for smoking cessation. Methods: Participants were randomized to a basic Internet (BI) comparison condition ( N = 675), enhanced Internet (EI: N = 651), or EI plus telephone counseling (EI + P: N = 679). The primary outcome was 30-day point prevalence abstinence (ppa) at 3 and 6 months. Assigned intervention use was assessed with automated tracking data. Assessment of non-assigned treatments included pharmacotherapy, behavioral, alternative, and non-study Internet treatments. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models examined whether non-assigned treatment use was associated with 30-day ppa. Results: About 70% of participants used at least one non-assigned treatment. A higher rate of non-study Internet treatment among BI participants was the only treatment group difference at both 3 and 6 months. Multivariate models controlling for condition and baseline predictors of non-assigned treatment use showed that high-intensity non-study Internet treatment was positively associated with 30-day ppa at 3 and 6 months, and pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatment use was negatively associated with 30-day ppa at 6 months. Conclusions: Non-assigned treatment use is an important factor to consider when evaluating Internet cessation interventions. Results highlight methodological issues in selecting a comparison condition. Researchers should report non-assigned treatment use alongside main trial outcomes.

This Article (published Online First on Aug 26, 2014) was funded by the Medical Research Council and should have had a Gold Open Access license (license type CC BY). The funding details and copyright line in the article’s Summary have been updated in the online version and the Article has been made open access as of Feb 25, 2015.] Background: In four previous studies, we have delineated the role of positive circuit coupling between the dorsal medial prefrontal (anterior cingulate) cortex and the amygdala during aversive processing in healthy people under stress. This translational circuit—the aversive amplification circuit—is thought to drive adaptive, harm-avoidant behaviour in threatening environments. We assess the role of this circuit in the pathological manifestation of anxiety disorders. Methods: For this single-site study, 45 unmedicated participants (22 with generalised and/or social anxiety disorder and 23 healthy controls) were recruited via advertisements from the metropolitan area of Washington, DC (USA). People who applied to participate in the study had to pass an initial telephone screen and comprehensive screening by a clinician at the National Institutes of Health (NIH; Bethesda, MD, USA). People with a contraindicated medical disorder, past or current psychiatric disorders other than anxiety disorders, and those using psychoactive medications or illicit drugs were excluded. Eligible individuals could participate as either a healthy control or a patient, depending on diagnosis. They were asked to use a button box to complete a simple emotion identification task (fearful vs happy faces; 44 trials of each) during functional MRI at the NIH. Functional imaging analysis consisted of event-related activation analysis and psychophysiological interaction connectivity analysis of regions coupled with the amygdala during task performance. Findings: A diagnosis-by-valence interaction was recorded in whole-brain amygdala connectivity within the dorsal medial prefrontal (anterior cingulate) cortex clusters identified in our previous study, driven by significantly increased circuit coupling during processing of fearful faces versus happy faces in anxious, but not healthy, participants. Importantly, and in accordance with contemporary theoretical approaches to psychiatry, circuit coupling correlated positively with self-reported anxious symptoms, which provides evidence of a continuous association between the circuit and subjective symptoms. Interpretation: In this study and our previous work, we track the functional role of one neural circuit from its involvement in adaptive threat biases under stress, to its chronic engagement in anxiety disorders in the absence of experimentally induced stress. Thus, we uniquely map a mood and anxiety-related circuit across its adaptive and maladaptive stages. Clinically, this study could provide a step towards a more mechanistic continuum-based approach to anxiety disorder diagnosis and might ultimately lead to more targeted treatments for patients with anxiety disorders.

When used effectively, technology can bring students together in cooperative efforts and enhance student experiences. Accessing information through the internet can broaden the curriculum deepen students’ learning. Instructional technology can remove geographical and communication barriers that limit learning. Technology can provide students with immediate feedback. By enabling students to cooperate in learning to read, write, and discuss, work with several medias simultaneously, illustrate reports, create multimedia projects, cover relevant events together, create websites and webpages, engage in inquiry projects that take place in any corner of the world, and play multiplayer simulation games requiring them to solve problems and live together peacefully, technology can revolutionize how members of cooperative groups interact and work other. Teachers can use technology to track the work of students and cooperative groups and create learning communities both within the classroom and the world as a whole. None of these uses of technology has to separate or isolate students, instead these technological tools can enable and enhance the cooperative learning experiences of students.

Calcium indicator fluorescence imaging is one of the main techniques for investigating the mechanisms governing this physiological process and its pathologies. The effective spatiotemporal resolution of calcium signals is, however, limited by the motion of contracting tissue: structures of interest in the order of microns can move over a hundred times their width during a contraction. The simultaneous changes in local intensity and tissue configuration make motion tracking a non‐trivial problem in image analysis and confound many of the standard techniques. This paper presents a method that tracks local motion throughout the tissue and allows for the almost complete removal of motion artefacts. This provides a stabilized calcium signal down to a pixel resolution, which, for the data examined, is in the order of a few microns. As a byproduct of image stabilization, a complete kinematic description of the contraction–relaxation cycle is also obtained. This contains novel information about the mechanical response of the tissue, such as the identification of a characteristic length scale, in the order of 40–50 μm, below which tissue motion is homogeneous. Applied to our data, we illustrate that the method allows for analyses of calcium dynamics in contracting myometrium in unprecedented spatiotemporal detail. Additionally, we use the kinematics of tissue motion to compare calcium signals at the subcellular level and local contractile motion. The computer code used is provided in a freely modifiable form and has potential applicability to  in vivo calcium imaging of neural tissue, as well as other smooth muscle tissue.

Because consumption most often returns to baseline levels when incentives are removed, sustainable long-duration interventions may be needed to impact public health. Anticipating that low-cost interventions will be more appealing to schools, the present study explored a low-cost, game-based intervention. Method: An alternating-treatments design was used to evaluate the effects of the FIT Game on objectively measured FV consumption in one elementary school ( n = 251) in Utah. During the Fall 2013 semester, game-based rewards were provided to heroic characters within a fictional narrative read by teachers on days when the school, as a whole, met a fruit or vegetable consumption goal in accord with the alternating-treatments design. Results: On intervention days, fruit and vegetable consumption increased by 39% and 33%, ( p < 0.01, p < 0.05; binomial tests), respectively. Teacher surveys indicated that students enjoyed the game and grade 1–3 teachers recommended its use in other schools. Conclusion: This game-based intervention provides a promising step towards developing a low-cost, effective, and sustainable FV intervention that schools can implement without outside assistance.

Objectives: The aim was to evaluate an interactive Web-based weight loss program on eating behaviors using the 18-item Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised (TFEQ-R18) which measures uncontrolled eating, emotional eating, and cognitive restrained eating. Our Web-based weight loss program is comprised of information about healthy lifestyle choices, weekly chats with experts, social networking features, databases for recipe searches, and features allowing members to self-report and track their weight, physical activity, and dietary intake on the website. Methods: On registering for the weight loss program, 23,333 members agreed to take part in the research study. The participants were then asked to complete the TFEQ-R18 questionnaire at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of participation. All data collection was conducted online, with no face-to-face contact. To study changes in TFEQ-R18 eating behaviors we restricted our study to those members who completed all 3 TFEQ-R18 questionnaires. These participants were defined as “completers” and the remaining as “noncompleters.” The relationships between sex, change in eating behaviors, and total weight loss were studied using repeated measures ANOVA and Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: In total, 22,800 individuals participated (females: 19,065/22,800, 83.62%; mean age 39.6, SD 11.4 years; BMI 29.0 kg/m2; males: 3735/22,800, 16.38%; mean age 43.2, SD 11.7 years; BMI 30.8 kg/m²). Noncompleters (n = 22,180) were younger and reported a lower score of uncontrolled eating and a higher score of cognitive restrained eating. Over time, completers (n = 620) decreased their uncontrolled eating score (from 56.3 to 32.0;  P < .001) and increased their cognitive restrained eating (from 50.6 to 62.9; P < .001). Males decreased their emotional eating (from 57.2 to 35.9; P < .001), but no significant change was found among females. The baseline cognitive restrained eating score was significantly and positively associated with weight loss for completers in both men ( P = .02) and women ( P = .002). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the largest TFEQ sample that has been documented. This Web-based weight loss intervention suggests that eating behaviors (cognitive restrained eating, uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating) measured by TFEQ-R18 were significantly changed during 6 months of participation. Our findings indicate differences in eating behaviors with respect to sex, but should be interpreted with caution because attrition was high.

Method: All public school principals (N=2,359) in North Carolina were invited to participate in an online survey (February – May, 2013) designed to provide baseline information about the extent and nature of shared use of school facilities. Results: Responses (n=1182, 50.1%) indicated that most schools share their facilities (88.9%). Formal agreements were more common when schools shared gyms and outdoor athletic fields. Informal agreements were most common with playgrounds and track facilities. Schools with more low income or Black students were less likely to share facilities. For schools that did not share use of their facilities the most frequent reason was no outside groups had ever asked. Conclusion: Schools may be more accommodating to shared use partnerships. Community organizations seeking to use indoor school facilities or athletic fields should be prepared to complete a formal written agreement. Preconceived notions that schools are unwilling to share their facilities may be preventing community organizations from initiating shared use inquiries. Schools located in the middle tier of economic distress and schools with a greater concentration of Black students were less likely to share their facilities.

This process is deeply personal and requires attention to clients’ abilities, interests, personality, and work values, as well as their relational lives. Indeed, it should not artificially separate typically objectively measured traits from subjectively experienced personal and emotional life. Attending to so many relevant and conflicting factors can at times seem overwhelming to clients as well as practitioners. What may at first seem disparate aspects of the self can be made manageable for clients through a strategic effort that involves identifying patterns among critical sources of quantitative and qualitative data and shaping them into a coherent and meaningful whole. We approach this chapter with these ideas in mind as we examine integrative approaches to career intervention. The topic of integration within psychotherapy and counseling has numerous meanings, ranging from integrative theoretical orientations (Norcross & Goldfried, 2005) to blending multiple sources of assessment data into the process of counseling. In this chapter, we offer a framework that can guide practitioners in combining diverse sets of information to strengthen their work with clients. First, we survey literature examining the concept of integration to provide context for intervention strategies covered and summarize integrative career assessment models. In particular, we examine Rottinghaus and Miller’s (2013) integrative personality model as a framework for guiding career assessment and merging psychometric data into a meaningful narrative. Second, using this comprehensive model, we identify counseling interventions and techniques that draw on integrative case conceptualization. This section features several standardized career assessments and Internet career guidance systems that allow for the joint consideration of important constructs that facilitate a more holistic understanding of career concerns. Finally, we present a case study to show how the integrative personality approach can be used in counseling a client facing an unplanned career transition. Our aim is to assist readers in contemplating integrative theoretical influences to achieve a strategic balanced perspective to benefit their clientele.

The methodology employed is based on a combination of data from website log files and questionnaires ( n = 207). The results show that tourism innovativeness is positively related to the frequency and density of site visits, downloading of information brochures, use of the online purchasing mode, and the volume of online purchases. Tourism innovativeness is also positively associated with consumer chatting and e-mailing. The study reveals that consumers high on tourism innovativeness maintain active and cooperative communications with the firm.

Visitability is designing houses in a way that enables people to visit others' homes regardless of physical limitations or use of mobility assistive devices. Objective: The goals of this study were to develop a set of questions about visitability that could be used for surveillance and to assess the prevalence and correlates of visitability features in Florida. Methods: We added five questions to the 2011 Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ( n = 12,399 respondents) and used complementary log–log regression models to estimate the prevalence ratio of each visitability feature. Results: The prevalence of visitability features in Florida homes was high for respondents with and without disabilities, though there was variation by visitability feature. A level entrance to the home and wide doorways were present in most respondents' homes (84.9% and 86.2%, respectively), while a main floor bathroom (59.6%) and a zero-step entrance (45.4%) were reported less commonly. People with a disability were less likely to report that their own home had doorways wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair compared to people without a disability (PR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.80–0.95). Visitability features were less common in households with lower income and also in trailers or mobile homes than in detached single-family homes. Conclusions: The survey questions used in this study could be implemented in other states to measure and track visitability and monitor progress toward the Healthy People 2020 goal. Building or retro-fitting homes to include visitability features could increase the participation and inclusion of people with disabilities in community life.

As important as the  ability to communicate in the L2 is the willingness to use the L2 or, what has been identified in the literature as Willingness to Communicate (WTC). Language is best learned when situated in, and based on, real-life experiences. Technological tools such as virtual worlds, mobile devices, and augmented reality (AR) are increasingly used to take language learning outside of the classroom. The affordances (e.g., portability, engagement, context-sensitivity) of these tools may have an impact on the following WTC antecedents: perceived competence, reduced L2 anxiety, security, excitement, and responsibility. The nature of this impact suggests that an AR mobile game may positively affect students' WTC. The purpose of this case study was to examine student perceptions regarding the use and design qualities of an AR mobile game in the language learning process and the effect of these qualities on student perceptions of their WTC. Nine students in a second-year Japanese language class at an institute of higher education in California participated in the study by playing an AR mobile game for three weeks. Data were collected through a demographic survey, game-play observations, game artifacts in the form of images and audio, game log data, and interviews. Findings suggest that AR mobile games can provide a viable means to take language learning outside the classroom and into self-selected spaces to affect positively students' WTC. From this investigation, it is evident that AR mobile language learning games can: (a) extend learning outside the classroom, (b) reduce L2 anxiety, and (c) promote personalized learning.

Six middle school (grades 6-8) science teachers from districts inside of North Carolina were selected to participate. Data was collected for this case study through audio-recorded semi-structured interviews, teachercreated artifacts, and teacher logs. Findings from this study suggest that situated technology professional development has the potential to positively impact the way teachers perform professional development. Teachers from this study believed that a combined course and self-guided approach had the greatest potential to enhance teacher practice. Additional findings from this study include a Technology Abundance Paradox (TAP) which outlines the idea that schools and classrooms have abundant technology, but insufficient training to use it. Teachers are continually being charged with finding their own professional development training, but also face barriers to that training, such as lack of time, resources, and support. A list of criteria for optimal professional development was created based on the feedback from teacher participants and can be used to enhance current and future technology professional development. The research questions driving the study were: (1) What are teachers’s experiences with situated technology professional development programs that help teachers learn to integrate technology consistent with National Educational Technology Standards for Teachers (NETS-T)? Participants in this study found the two programs utilized in this study to be relevant, engaging, helped to create personalized materials, and aligned to the ISTE NETS standards. (2) What characteristics of selected situated professional development programs help teachers meet their need for self-directed, in-context, time-sensitive training? Participants noted that the course approach to situated technology professional development as better than the self-paced model and cited that it was what they were use to, appreciated being told what to do in a step-by-step manner, and liked that it allowed them to plan time better because they knew what to expect. However, several aspects of the self-paced approach to situated technology professional development were noted as valuable, including; providing participants with inspirational models, ideas, and examples through video and sample lessons, introduced practical technology tools, and allowed time for self discovery. (3) What limitations of situated professional development programs should be improved to better meet teacher needs? Participants in this study noted a lack of communication between collagues and a facilitator, no grade level or content area tracks, limited or no table of contents, and need for more audio as limitations to the two programs utilized. (4) What similarities and differences are noted between a course approach and self-guided approach to situated professional development? Participants cited structure and assessment as differences in the two programs; Intel was organized and sequential compared to Edutopia, and Intel provided quizzes and an Action plan while Edutopia did not. A similarity noted by participants that was valuable was choice. Intel participants were able to chooce two out of six different modules, while Edutopia participants were able to navigate their own path through the program by choosing hyperlinks.

Research has shown the aviation industry, military operations, and medical field utilize impressive simulations allowing people to refine their technical and nontechnical skills in a ""no consequence"" environment. Grounded in team cognitive and group dynamic research, researchers are focusing their efforts on how to effectively use simulation as a training tool. The focus of this study was to determine how the degree of simulation difficulty affects teamwork. With a unique high fidelity simulation lab, the participants completed 3 hour work shifts to a run a simulated regional airline. Teamwork was based on the following five variables: contributing to teamwork, interacting with the team, keeping the team on track, expecting quality, and having the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA's). The experimental design consisted of three teams randomly assigned to either a minimal, moderate, or maximum level of difficulty. After completion of the simulation, the participants completed an online survey for evaluations of their performance. The findings suggest some components of teamwork are affected by the design of the simulation, while others are not as susceptible to its effects. It was discovered the level of difficulty significantly affected individual and group performance in their expectation of quality and having relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA's). As simulation difficulty only affected two out of the five teamwork variables, this leads to the conclusion that generally a team will perform based on their level of team cognition and efficient group behaviors, not necessarily based on the degree of difficulty presented during a simulation.

Following a review of variables that have been established to influence the expression of personality, including genetic disposition, cultural family of origin theory, and group socialization experiences, this ethnographical, quasi-experimental mixed methods study compares personality variables derived from MMPI-2 protocols obtained from participants of online massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs). Participants were administered the MMPI-2 at baseline and then again upon asking to assume the role of their online character, responding to the instrument from that perspective. Results indicate that players' in-game alliances will have an effect on the personality scales. Those who choose to align with the ""Horde"" faction will display elevated scale scores when compared to their baseline. Those who choose to align with the ""Alliance"" faction will display an overall decrease in scale score averages. In addition to the MMPI results, the author utilizes a qualitative research approach to describe and qualify the study subjects' participation in the digital world. Participant play style while in game affects the personality of the avatar. Those who participate in the Horde faction will display higher levels of psychopathic deviant behavior, paranoia, and hypomania. Those who play Alliance characters will create a character consistent with supporting and helping others, using traits and magic that do not induce fear. Implications of the study are discussed and explored on a variety of levels. These four levels include an exploration of the theoretical, methodological, clinical, and philosophical potentials in the research. Theoretically, the research implies that the development of a well-formed personality with internal consistency can exist in a digital format independent of the player's own personality. Methodologically, the utilization of assessment tools in varying environments can be successfully applied in ways that track and measure variances outside of its intention. Clinically, there is potential use of digital avatars to explore characteristics and traits in an individual's personality that would be key to aid and support therapeutically. Finally, this is an exploration of the philosophical implications involved with separate and varying personality traits contained within the same individual.

Questions persist, however, regarding evaluation competencies as well as how universities prepare future evaluators. A three-stage, mixed-methods study was conducted to examine desired evaluation skills within the job market and university-based evaluation education programs. First, an inductive analysis of 70 job descriptions (35 U.S., 35 international) was conducted and was used to augment an existing evaluation competency taxonomy (Dewey et al., 2008). Results revealed a range of opportunities for evaluators based on the skills desired by employers, as well as a set of key skills relevant for evaluation practice across work contexts. Second, an online curricular document analysis was conducted to identify and examine degrees offered by evaluation education programs. Results indicated substantial growth in evaluation education programs from 1980 to present, with 106 universities offering 178 degrees across the world. The most significant growth was observed for certificate and master's degrees. Further findings showed differences in the type of curricula covered across degree tracks and by academic department. Finally, a crosswalk analysis was conducted to explore the alignment between desired evaluation skills and university curricula. Areas of strong alignment were identified in quantitative design and statistical analysis. Conditional alignment was found related to qualitative designs, mixed methods, evaluation theory. Less alignment was found related to evaluation capacity building, management, and program design and implementation. Implications for the evaluation profession, practitioners, and evaluation education programs, as well as future directions for research are discussed.

Other chapters in this volume focus on feedback from multiple vantage points, specifically, 360-degree feedback for development, how employees support each other and encourage development through feedback in social networks, and how feedback contributes to learning. These elements are incorporated in applications of feedback. Feedback is not a standalone event but part of a performance management process that includes (a) articulation of the department’s mission and alignment of the employee’s job and strengths with department and company goals, (b) ongoing discussions about expectations, (c) developmental experiences, including challenging assignments and mentoring, (d) regular discussions about performance, (e) clear standards of performance, (f) job training and training in how to seek and use feedback (and for managers, give feedback), and (g) surveys to track satisfaction and perceptions of the job, supervisor, and opportunities for development. Our chapter establishes the foundation for understanding why feedback is important and how it can be structured and delivered to be accurate, accepted, and, most importantly, used to improve job performance. We show how feedback can be beneficial and also how it can be detrimental to performance and the employee’s sense of self-esteem. We consider the value of feedback to the individual employee, the team, and the organization, and the role of all of these perspectives to understanding how feedback is structured and operates. We begin by examining what we know about feedback from research and theories of learning and development that determine the effectiveness of feedback interventions.

Upon entering residential treatment, foster children's social relationships may change more or less drastically. The nature of their social relationships and how they change remain unclear; yet, social relationships likely influence children's behavior both positively and negatively. Using Kahn and Antonucci's (1980) convoy model of social relations as a theoretical and methodological framework, this study examined changes in the structure and function of foster children's social relationships (""social convoys"") during their first 3 months in residential treatment and how those relate to behavioral problems. This study used a prospective longitudinal survey method to assess social convoys and behavioral problems of 9 to 13 year-old foster children in two residential treatment centers. The researcher administered Children's Convoy Mapping Procedure to children and Youth Outcome Questionnaire 30 to child care workers within one month of intake and 3 months later. Data analysis techniques included social network methods, multilevel models, and cluster analysis. Foster children in this study included a variety of close and important individuals in their social convoys. At baseline, four distinct types of social convoys emerged: balanced-supportive, family-focused more support functions, family-focused fewer support functions, and peer-focused. Over the three months of treatment, children reconstructed their social convoys by adding, keeping, and removing individuals who could or could not provide social support, especially long-term tangible aid of providing care in crisis. Participants with family-focused fewer support functions social convoys, tight-knit networks of family members that provided relatively less support, had the best behavioral outcome. The results suggest that social convoys of foster children change in many different ways during residential treatment. The environmental attributes of residential treatment, both at the time of transition (e.g. multiple caregivers) and during treatment (e.g. resident turnover), may influence the way children reconstruct their social convoys. This study demonstrated how the convoy mapping method can track short-term changes in foster children's social relationships and has promise for allowing practitioners to regularly assess children's social convoys. Such assessments may provide points of intervention based on the children's perspectives.

Computers, phones, still and video cameras have evolved into an all-in-one device with Internet access providing access to any information, whenever, and wherever the individual wants it. Wireless mobile phones and tablets allow the Internet and its digital affordances to flow into every hand, everywhere, in every circumstance. Powerful, convenient, multi-purpose, mobile phones and tablets are the two key players in the fast growing world of mobile computers. With mobile communications being more affordable, youth from low socio-economic households and communities have greater opportunities to engage in the digital world. This case study used connective ethnographic methods to address two questions: What are the literacy practices of six lower socio-economic status urban youth aged 16 to 18 years in north-eastern USA while engaged with mobile technology? How and what mobile technologies were being used by these urban youth and how did these influence literacy practices? The goal of this dissertation was to better understand the influence of mobile technology on literacy practices when used by a particular group bounded by age, time, ownership, and place. The participants were six students aged 16-18 years old, attending an urban low socio-economic situated high school in the northeastern United States. Literacy practices were observed in both on- and offline spaces through observations, interviews, literacy logs, and through the use of remote monitoring software, loaded on participants' smart phones and laptops for a two-week period. A focus group was conducted at the end of data collection. Tablets, while owned by participants were deemed redundant by participants and often given away to other family members. Analysis of the extensive data set led to five critical findings that will add to the current understanding on how mobile technologies influenced the literacy practices of these urban youth: (1) choice of mobile technology, (2) creation of meaning/social semiosis, (3) communication hierarchy and the critical role of connectedness, (4) the impact of trust on communication and engagement in on- and offline communities, and (5) the concept of tinkering bounded by technology, mistrust, and non-public participation.

"8WQQR8LE","thesis","2015","Madrigal, Leilani","The relationships among mental toughness, hardiness, optimism and coping: A structural equation modeling approach","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1676371177?accountid=14026","Sport can be stressful with the time demands, emphasis on winning, and high expectations. Being able to positively reinterpret events, remain calm and relaxed under pressure, and maintain emotional control may be essential to athletes' ability to cope with the various demands of sport. These elements are characteristics of mental toughness (Crust & Clough, 2005), which may be a protective factor in coping with demands of sport. This research examined the reliability and validity of the Mental Toughness Scale (MTS) by investigating relationships of mental toughness with coping behavior, and related constructs of hardiness and optimism. Specifically, four aims were addressed in the current study. The first aim assessed the factor structure and gender variance of the MTS, while the second aim examined the validity of the MTS. The third aim assessed relationships of mental toughness with related constructs of hardiness and optimism and coping behavior within a structural model. The fourth aim explored gender differences on the main variables as well as relationships among these variables. Five hundred and seventy collegiate athletes from various sports (i.e., soccer, baseball/softball, basketball, wrestling, track & field, cross-country, tennis, volleyball, field hockey, lacrosse, swimming, and rifle) and levels of play completed measures (either online or via a hard copy in group settings) assessing mental toughness, hardiness, optimism, and coping. Using correlation/regression analysis and Structural Equation Modeling, the MTS was found to be a valid measure of mental toughness and was superior to hardiness or optimism in predicting approach styles of coping (i.e., problem-, emotion-focused coping) in response to sport-related stress. Additionally, there were no gender differences on the main variables or in the relationships between mental toughness and coping. Although research on mental toughness is still in its infancy, the findings demonstrate that the MTS is a psychometrically strong tool for assessing mental toughness and that mental toughness is superior to hardiness and optimism in predicting positive coping behaviors. More work is needed on the possible stress-buffering effects of mental toughness and benefits of this positive psychological characteristic. Future work can then determine how mental toughness can be developed and what populations (e.g., injured, transitioning athletes) may gain most from its benefits.

Given this historic milestone, an understanding of the journal's content and impact might inform its readership about the field of literacy broadly and the contribution of RRQ in particular. This study reports a content and trend analysis using a convergent parallel mixed methods design to profile the content of 50 years of RRQ. Grounded in polysystem and cultural field theories, four parallel investigative tracks afforded a complementary understanding of what the journal has published over five decades and together highlight salient aspects of the journal's history. Analyses targeted the most frequently researched topics and populations, as well as trends in research and analysis types and most frequently cited articles. Bibliometric data add information about the status and online use of the journal as it celebrates its 50th year. In addition, a qualitative analysis of editorials complements the quantitative data to provide a panoramic retrospective that answers five research questions. Data led the researchers to identify trends that supported identification of five pillars that characterize the nature and impact of RRQ in the past and present. Recommendations are made about how RRQ might preserve its core strengths or pillars and develop new directions to expand its influence and impact.

These ailments are closely related to the aging process of the human body, and their populations are growing rapidly in developed nations. Thus, there is a great need for a simple, inexpensive, reliable, and objective assessment system. This dissertation introduces a system for assessing hand motor dysfunction, which is a common symptom of CSM, using a mobile handgrip device with simple target tracking tests. Data collected from $30$ CSM patients and $30$ age-matched control subjects is used to validate the system's three fundamental quantification objectives using a reliable feature selection technique: detecting the severity of hand motor deficits, correlation to the patients' perceived motor deficits, and detecting the changes in motor conditions as a result of medical treatment (e.g., surgical operation). Then, this dissertation introduces a more in-depth algorithm that quantifies the level of hyperreflexia, which is an unique symptom of CSM patients closely related to their fine motor controllability. This thesis further discusses a prediction algorithm that estimates the postoperative functional outcomes of CSM patients using their clinical, demographic, and preoperative functional (handgrip) information. The handgrip device has also been tested on patients with other types of neuromotor ailments such as cerebral vascular accident (CVA) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) through a pilot study. A technical solution to quantification of motor function for patients suffering from lower back spinal disorders (e.g., LSS) is briefly discussed as a future work.

Advances in technology offer researchers opportunities to test new strategies and modalities. This dissertation examined the utility of a wearable device/sensor with website (Fitbit One) and SMS text messaging prompts to increase physical activity (PA) in overweight/obese adults. It also examined participants' level of engagement with intervention components and factors associated with engagement.  Methods: In a 6-week randomized controlled pilot trial, 67 participants were provided a Fitbit One for self-monitoring and half were randomized to receive daily text messaging PA prompts. Primary outcomes were objectively measured steps and minutes of PA by intensity level using Actigraph GT3X+ and Fitbit One. Self-reported baseline and follow-up surveys were analyzed to assess participants' attitudes and level of engagement with intervention components (Fitbit One and text messages), and whether self-efficacy and outcome expectations could predict level of engagement. Secondary data were analyzed from the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) Study to examine adherence to study protocols and dietary change by baseline depressive symptoms in women who were enrolled in a large dietary trial that focused on behavioral activation components. Results: (1) Daily text messaging prompts were associated with short-term PA increases but only for 1 week, and Fitbit One (without text messages) was associated with an increase in MVPA at week 6. (2) Participants who used the Fitbit mobile app increased their steps at week 6. (3) Baseline depressive symptoms predicted lower adherence to study protocols, but only in control participants, and (among those furthest from recommended targets at baseline) less improvements in change in plasma carotenoid concentrations, fiber, and fat. Conclusions: Participants' level of engagement with the study intervention was associated with health behavior change. Text messages as PA prompts were insufficient to keep participants engaged to maintain PA changes beyond 1 week. Fitbit One, particularly the Fitbit mobile app, which is both accessible and provides instant detailed feedback for self-monitoring, was helpful in increasing PA. Lastly, a dietary intervention with behavioral activation components increased level of engagement in both non-depressed and depressed women who made dietary improvements.

"9TJUY6QH","thesis","2015","Griffin, Stacy A.","Interaction: Student perceptions of knowledge acquisition in the asynchronous learning environment","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1692317312?accountid=14026","The purpose of the qualitative descriptive study was to explore how interaction in the asynchronous learning environment affects student perceptions on knowledge construction. Despite the continuing growth of online learning, few researchers have explored ways in which asynchronous discourse affects cognition. The data collection methodology for the study included a digital, six-question, open-ended survey hosted on the online vendor Survey Monkey and completed by 27 teacher candidates. All of the participants had experience taking a traditional and an asynchronous college level course. Conventional content analysis was used, involving an inductive process and the inclusion of the computer analysis program Hermetic Systems Word Frequency Advanced Version Software. The analysis resulted in the identification of six major themes: amount of interaction, questions, peers, participation, convenience, and increased interaction. The main conclusions drawn from this research study were that more interaction than that found in a traditional classroom is required for authentic knowledge acquisition in the asynchronous environment. Asynchronous students construct more knowledge when they are proficient in the four types of interaction: learner-to-instructor, learner-to-learner, learner-to-content, and learner-to-interface. The first set of recommendations included the following: instructors should (a) establish a sense of immediacy, (b) create cybercafés, and (c) use digital tools to track student participation. The final recommendation was that educational leaders should require students to demonstrate technological proficiency before enrolling in an asynchronous course. These recommendations are significant to scholars, practitioners, and leaders in the asynchronous online learning community.

The first part of the study used content analysis and adopted a social constructionist lens, revealing the occurrence of socially shared regulatory processes in CSCL. Log files from three sessions of 13 undergraduate student groups were analyzed. The first key finding of this study was the identification of seven socially shared regulatory processes (planning and goal setting, scheduling, role assignment, task monitoring, content monitoring, task evaluation, and content evaluation) emerging in CSCL, suggesting that an analytical framework of cognitive regulatory processes in individual self-regulated learning can be applied to collective regulation in CSCL. Second, high quality regulation can be called socially shared regulation in the true sense of the word because multiple members successfully involved their shared regulation by establishing shared plans, shared goals, shared monitoring, and shared meaning of their learning. The second part of the study was a case study using content analysis, social network analysis, and quantitative analysis of group members’ self-report questionnaires. Three group regulation patterns were identified: a socially shared regulation group, a mixed regulation group and an other-regulation group. The key finding was that the socially shared regulation group showed more dynamic social interaction and high quality regulation than the other two groups. The mixed regulation group also demonstrated dynamic social interaction but with the existence of a dominant member. The other-regulation group revealed dyadic social interaction between a dominant member and the rest of the members. This study hopes to provide educators with tangible and practical knowledge of online course design and the implementation of online group discussion.

In theory, the observed market response originates from latent characteristics of the market such as consumers' preference for products and features and the competitive landscape. Understanding these latent characteristics is essential in making high quality marketing decisions. However, finding a reliable and inexpensive proxy for them is a challenge. We explore the possibility of using insights from ""big data"" sources to better identify these latent characteristics. We apply our techniques to analyze the market for automobiles in the US. In Essay 1, we explore the potential of using trends in online searches for feature-related keywords as proxies for trends in the relative importance consumers place on the corresponding features. The relative importance consumers place on features may vary over time due to factors beyond the control of marketers (e.g., shifts in economic conditions, advances in technology). We make the baseline attractiveness of 70 top-selling automobiles a function of Google Trends indexes for five common features: fuel efficiency, acceleration, body type, cost to buy, and cost to operate. We find strong empirical evidence supporting the notion that the evolution of feature search intensity contains genuine information about shifting consumers' tastes. In essay 2, we propose a model that identifies (1) the position of products on a latent perceptual map, (2) the consumer segments, and (3) the ideal point of the preference for each segment. The product positions are inferred using a novel approach using big data on online consumers' activities. We show that our proposed approach performs better than alternative approaches in identifying latent product positions.

"XJ58AJPY","thesis","2015","Mao, Huina","Modeling economic and financial behavior from large-scale datasets","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1703279097?accountid=14026","Every facet of our daily life is being recorded by our communication infrastructure. Billions of individuals leave digital traces in social media, search engines, phone records, emails, GPS data, shopping records, and electronic sensors. These datasets are available on unprecedented large scale, with fine granularity, and in real time, which provide great resources for research and enhance our ability to study individual and collective behavioral patterns. This dissertation focuses on modeling economic and financial behavior from large-scale datasets recorded by social media, search engines, news media, and mobile phone services. First, we study the dynamic properties of collective and individual mood states from large-scale social media content, in particular Twitter micro-blog updates, with an emphasis on longitudinal changes, their statistical properties, and their relations to a variety of socio-economic phenomena. As part of this research program, we develop a multi-dimensional mood analysis method, to track public mood from Twitter in six dimensions, namely,  calm, alert, sure, vital, kind, and happy, which capture the rich structure of human mood in real-time. In support of this approach, we discovered that Twitter calmness has predictive information with respect to short-term stock market returns. Second, to further explore the relations between collective mood states and market returns, we attempt to disentangle the relation between social mood and investor sentiment. We introduce a simple, direct, and unambiguous indicator of online investor sentiment by examining finance related keyword frequencies in Twitter updates and Google search queries. We found that Twitter and Google bullishness lead, i.e. positively correlate with, investor sentiment surveys. Also, we found that Twitter bullishness predicts stock return increases, followed by a reversal to the underlying fundamentals, in line with the Investor Sentiment Hypothesis in behavioral finance. Third, we study how linguistic and social differences affect public mood states using a method that automatically converges on a semantic orientation lexicon from the analysis of large-scale news corpora. This work has applications in financial sentiment analysis in non-English languages, for which sentiment analysis resources can be scarce. Assuming that the stock market is the product of human collective judgments on the valence of news reports, we leverage market movement data to assess term valence in news report, i.e.~implicitly crowd-source news sentiment evaluation. This data is used to iteratively optimize a semantic orientation lexicon through an evolutionary process of semantic extension and pruning. We show that the obtained semantic orientation lexicon achieve high levels of accuracy in identifying the polarity of Chinese news articles. Finally, we study how economic development patterns are manifested in large-scale mobile phone communication networks. In a case study of mobile phone records for a developing nation, Cote d'Ivoire, we show that mobile phone communication data can provide an accurate and detailed picture of economic development, even for low-income areas with poor information infrastructure. Our findings lay the ground work for future research that leverages mobile communication data to accurately analyze the current status of economic development within a nation at low cost, thereby allowing governments and aid organizations to respond swiftly and effectively to changing conditions.

"QNZEHAL9","thesis","2015","Kelley, Timothy D.","Systemic effects of human factors in information security","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1724424856?accountid=14026","This dissertation couples the growing corpus of human subjects and behavioral research in information security with large-scale data and robust quantitative methods. Linking human subject experimentation with theoretical models enables the information security community to reason more effectively about the system-wide effects of user behavior. I examine how users interact with the digital environment, how those interactions affect decision-making, and how aggregate decision-making affects system-wide vulnerabilities. This interdisciplinary challenge requires a combination of techniques from cognitive neuroscience, social network analysis, human-subjects research, dynamical systems, network theory, and agent-based models. In the first section, eye-tracking data demonstrates the relationships between expertise and online perceptual awareness of security cues. Expertise is shown to be only a small factor in attention to security cues, and task-type proves to be much larger indicator of attention, with tasks requiring the use of personal accounts driving attention to cues. This section uses Bayesian ANOVA to evaluate users' perceptual awareness of security cues as they complete common online tasks, as it relates to user sophistication and task type. The second section uses a theoretical epidemiological model of malware spread to investigate factors that might mitigate the prevalence of malware in a coupled, two-population model. This both demonstrates that cost is the largest factor for affecting malware prevalence, outside of malware infection rates, and identifies appropriate strategies for system-wide botnet mitigation. The final section utilizes an agent-based model of mobile application adoption combined with social network data and mobile marketplace policy. The result is an examination of the dynamic effects of user and market behavior on the spread of mobile malware and the second order effects, such as privacy loss, due to that spread. This model reveals that well-regulated markets are effective at limiting malware spread, but user behavior grows in importance as markets become less restricted. Each study examines ways in which users interact with their technology, the aggregate effects of those behaviors, and identifies possible inflection points to change system-wide behaviors. This dissertation integrates empirical behavioral studies to develop a better understanding of digital behavior, thus enabling a more holistic approach to information security.

"GGAPUVGF","thesis","2015","Yoo, Woohyun","Communicating social support in smartphone-based addiction support groups: Seeking, giving, and receiving emotional support and their effects on alcoholism treatment","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1705044386?accountid=14026","The goal of this dissertation is to investigate the nature and roles of four types of communicating emotional support within smartphone-based support groups for individuals with alcohol dependence: (1) seeking support, (2) giving support, (3) receiving support from peer patients, and (4) receiving support from health care providers. I first explore the prediction model to explain how potential factors predict the four types of communicating emotional support. Second, I test the direct and stress-buffering models of communicating emotional support to demonstrate whether the four types of communicating emotional support promote abstinence on risky drinking days. Third, I examine the mediation model of coping to explain how the four types of communicating emotional support are related to risky drinking days via coping strategies. The smartphone-based support groups examined in this dissertation are online discussion groups within the Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A-CHESS) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Of the 170 participants who could access A-CHESS discussion groups through their smartphones during the 12-month study period, 153 either wrote or read messages in the groups. The final data used in the analyses were created by merging three data components: (1) messages posted in A-CHESS discussion groups, (2) action log data of A-CHESS discussion group usage, and (3) multiple waves of survey data. The results of the prediction model showed that each type of communicating emotional support was predicted by unique antecedents. In addition, the findings of the direct and stress-buffering models revealed that communicating emotional support contributed to alcoholism treatment not by producing direct benefits per se but by alleviating or changing the effect of emotional distress to trigger alcohol use. Finally, a coping mediation model showed that coping strategies mediated the relationship between communicating emotional support and risky drinking days. Taken together, this dissertation scrutinizes key issues regarding communicating emotional support in smartphone-based alcoholism support groups and delivers the following insights: (1) what people are more likely to communicate emotional support, (2) what benefits or drawbacks are likely to result from communicating emotional support, and (3) how communicating emotional support contributes to alcoholism treatment.

"WSPXADQ6","thesis","2015","Benoit, Edward, III","#Mplp: A comparison of domain novice and expert user-generated tags in a minimally processed digital archive","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1717510987?accountid=14026","The high costs of creating and maintaining digital archives precluded many archives from providing users with digital content or increasing the amount of digitized materials. Studies have shown users increasingly demand immediate online access to archival materials with detailed descriptions (access points). The adoption of minimal processing to digital archives limits the access points at the folder or series level rather than the item-level description users' desire. User-generated content such as tags, could supplement the minimally processed metadata, though users are reluctant to trust or use unmediated tags. This dissertation project explores the potential for controlling/mediating the supplemental metadata from user-generated tags through inclusion of only expert domain user-generated tags. The study was designed to answer three research questions with two parts each: 1(a) What are the similarities and differences between tags generated by expert and novice users in a minimally processed digital archive?, 1(b) Are there differences between expert and novice users' opinions of the tagging experience and tag creation considerations?, 2(a) In what ways do tags generated by expert and/or novice users in a minimally processed collection correspond with metadata in a traditionally processed digital archive?, 2(b) Does user knowledge affect the proportion of tags matching unselected metadata in a minimally processed digital archive?, 3(a) In what ways do tags generated by expert and/or novice users in a minimally processed collection correspond with existing users' search terms in a digital archive?, and 3(b) Does user knowledge affect the proportion of tags matching query terms in a minimally processed digital archive? The dissertation project was a mixed-methods, quasi-experimental design focused on tag generation within a sample minimally processed digital archive. The study used a sample collection of fifteen documents and fifteen photographs. Sixty participants divided into two groups (novices and experts) based on assessed prior knowledge of the sample collection's domain generated tags for fifteen documents and fifteen photographs (a minimum of one tag per object). Participants completed a pre-questionnaire identifying prior knowledge, and use of social tagging and archives. Additionally, participants provided their opinions regarding factors associated with tagging including the tagging experience and considerations while creating tags through structured and open-ended questions in a post-questionnaire. An open-coding analysis of the created tags developed a coding scheme of six major categories and six subcategories. Application of the coding scheme categorized all generated tags. Additional descriptive statistics summarized the number of tags created by each domain group (expert, novice) for all objects and divided by format (photograph, document). T-tests and Chi-square tests explored the associations (and associative strengths) between domain knowledge and the number of tags created or types of tags created for all objects and divided by format. The subsequent analysis compared the tags with the metadata from the existing collection not displayed within the sample collection participants used. Descriptive statistics summarized the proportion of tags matching unselected metadata and Chi-square tests analyzed the findings for associations with domain knowledge. Finally, the author extracted existing users' query terms from one month of server-log data and compared the generated-tags and unselected metadata. Descriptive statistics summarized the proportion of tags and unselected metadata matching query terms, and Chi-square tests analyzed the findings for associations with domain knowledge. Based on the findings, the author discussed the theoretical and practical implications of including social tags within a minimally processed digital archive.

Unschool practitioners have complete freedom to choose what they want to learn, when, to what level, and for how long. Unschooling families use the World Wide Web to provide a bespoke academic experience at home. This study compares qualitative data collected from questionnaires and semi-structured interviews conducted with 10 unschooling families with quantitative data collected from 5 children within these families using a tracking and monitoring software. The software captured the duration of use, keystrokes, mouseclicks, and screenshots for all programs and websites for 14 days. Children stated they used technology less than 6 hours a day, and parents stated children used them less than 8 hours a day. Quantitative data shows the children use technology at least 10 hours a day, suggesting usage self-reports may not be reliable. The study revealed hardware form factor was the number one determinate of application use. Almost exclusively social media was used on smartphones, internet browsing on tablets, and creative endeavors such as modding, hacking, fan fiction writing, and video game level building all took place exclusively on laptops and desktops. Concurrent use of differing hardware form factors was the norm observed. Participants stated YouTube, Wikipedia and Khan Academy were the websites most used for knowledge gathering. The tracking software verified YouTube and Wikipedia were the most used websites, however when accessed on the PC, those sites were used almost exclusively for video game related purposes. Over 90% of the total PC use was spent on video games. More traditional educational activities were done primarily on tablets and on parent smartphones with parental engagement. Khan Academy was not used by the participants in the 14 day monitoring period. 90 day web browser logs indicated Khan Academy was used by individuals no more than 3 times in a 90 day period, demonstrating the inherent risks in relying upon internet usage self-reports without quantitative software for verification. Unschooling children spent between 30 and 60 hours a week using technology.

The study was divided into two parts: the purpose of the first part of the research was to extend findings by Gunawardena and Zittle (1997) into the high school setting, and the second part compared several activities to investigate which of them were the most effective in enhancing social presence. A survey examining social presence and satisfaction and discussion board coding were the instruments used for Part 1. Part 2 utilized data from the same social presence and satisfaction survey, along with an additional survey examining perceived social presence per activity, an instructor survey, course activity/contact log data, and student retention/drop-out data. Three schools participated in the study, with a total of 40 instructors, 18 courses, and 277 students represented in Part 1; 727 discussion board postings by 105 students are analyzed in Part 2. Pearson's correlation, linear regression, and binary logistic regression were performed for data analysis. Schools were analyzed separately for the Part 2 analysis, as one school provided student-specific contact log data and the other two provided course-specific activity data. The results show that certain activities, namely personalized introductions, sending of official documents, notes, and course announcements, are strong predictors of high social presence. Students who had high social presence in personalized introductions and real-time web conferencing activities also had high social presence in the course overall. None of the specific activities tested was distinguished as a predictor of satisfaction. However, perceived social presence in certain activities, namely the personalized introduction, orientation activity, and use of web 2.0 tools, was a predictor of satisfaction. High social presence on team projects predicted low satisfaction. Sending frequent notes was shown to be a strong predictor of retention. Lastly, the results showed that high social presence in discussion board activities predicted a high retention rate. This research is intended to inform the design of online high school courses. The results provide data on what activities impact social presence, satisfaction, and retention, and the discussion in the conclusion will provide some reflections on how to effectively implement courses with integrated social presence.

"P6YXVTY7","thesis","2015","DeWind, Nicholas Kurshan","The neural basis of the number sense","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1727663176?accountid=14026","The ability to enumerate approximately without counting is an evolutionarily ancient and developmentally early core cognitive ability known as the ""number sense"". We use the number sense when we estimate a number without counting individual items, as when we guess the number of people in a crowded room. The number sense is theorized to form an instinctual building block upon which we create the conceptual structures of mathematics. This dissertation addresses three research questions regarding the number sense. The first is the question of whether the number sense is malleable, and if so, what are the neural correlates of malleability. In Chapter 2 we gave adults number sense training, which we found improved the accuracy of numerical estimation. In Chapter 4 we recorded from single neurons in monkeys while they viewed arrays of items on a computer screen. Similar recordings have been made previously, but usually using monkeys that were trained to discriminate sets based on number. Recordings in trained animals demonstrated that individual neurons in the monkey's brain track the number of items in a set. We reasoned that if the neural correlates of the number sense were altered by the training experience, then we would get different results in untrained monkeys. We did find neurons encoding numerical information in untrained monkeys, but at lower rates than described previously. Thus, we demonstrated that the number sense can improve with experience, and our data suggest that changes in the proportion of neurons encoding number may subserve this improvement. The second question is how to resolve the problem of stimulus control in laboratory tests of the number sense. Typically, number sense function is assessed by presenting arrays of dots on a computer screen. In such stimuli, however, non-numerical features necessarily covary with numerical features. By counter-balancing different stimulus conditions, it is possible to determine if number and not some other feature is influencing a dependent measure. In Chapter 3, we develop a technique to go further and determine which of eleven stimulus features is influencing a dependent measure. The third question is whether the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), a brain area known to be engaged during numerical cognition, is specialized for it. To address this question, we apply the technique developed in Chapter 3 to the neural data recorded from monkeys in Chapter 4. We show that the IPS does contain number neurons; however, it also contains neurons that encode many other features in equal proportion, indicating that it is not specialized for number. In Chapter 5, we use drugs injected into the IPS to reversibly inactivate it. We found that after IPS inactivation, performance on a numerical discrimination task was impaired but no more so than a color discrimination control task. Again, our data do not support the theory that the IPS is specialized for numerical processing.

"WYFJ88IR","thesis","2015","Taylor, Deborah L.","Interactions in online courses and student academic success","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1746989822?accountid=14026","The Sloan Foundation reported a phenomenal 17% annual growth in online course enrollment from 2002 through 2012, while the overall enrollment in higher education has shown only a 2.5% annual growth. Despite the growth in enrollment, McFadden and others have reported that drop out rates were as much as seven times higher for online courses. To address these concerns, this study investigated how three types of interactions (student-student, student-content and student-instructor) in the first two weeks of fully asynchronous online courses were associated with student academic success. This investigation analyzed archived tracking data from a learning management system for 1,703 students in 200 semester-long, fully online community college courses. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to consider the relationship between the three types of online interactions and academic success. The three types of independent interaction variables were measured as follows. Student-student interaction was the number of student posts to the discussion forums. Student-content interaction was the total number of pages the students accessed. Student-instructor interaction was a measure of the number of instructor posts and the number of instructor emails. The outcome measure, academic success, fell into three groups: successful completers (students completing the course with A, B, or C grades), low score completers (students completing the course with D or F grades), and non-completers (students who did not complete the course). Odds ratios derived from the regression analysis were used to determine the percentage of change in academic success attributable to each type of interaction, holding all other factors constant. The multinomial logistic regression was statistically significant (chi square = 461.96 p<. 001), indicating that the predictors reliably distinguished between the three outcome groups. The findings suggest that increasing the number of times a student posts by one unit (5 posts) would increase the individual's odds for success by 74% for the non-completers group and by 71% for those in the low score completers group. The findings also suggest that if an individual would increase interaction with the content by one unit (49 online pages) the individual's likelihood for success would increase by 57% for non-completers and 39% for low score completers. The number of instructor posts had no effect on the outcome for low score completers, however increasing the number of instructor discussion posts by one unit (15 posts) increased the likelihood that the students would complete the course by 34%. An increase in one unit (151 messages) of instructor email was associated with a 45% decrease in the odds for success for non-completers and a 28% decrease in the odds for success for the low score completers. This study provides support that student-student interaction and student-content interaction in the first two weeks of online courses contribute to student academic success with student-student interaction being most influential. More instructor postings in the discussion areas increased the likelihood that students would complete the course. The finding that the more instructors interacted with students by email the lower the academic success seems counterintuitive at first glance. This may be because instructor emails are often in response to increased requests for clarification by students and could be a reflection of poor course organization or insufficient course support materials.

As more and more data are being ""geo-referenced,"" opportunities arise for the inclusion of such data in MMR. For example, survey respondents' postcodes (zipcodes), or geo-referenced police crime data, can be mapped and related to other data in a multimethod project. Even qualitative data can be ""mapped""—the global positioning system tracks of mobile, go-along interviews and their accompanying transcripts may be geo-coded or geo-linked and analyzed in relation to the spatial location of the talk. Freely available maps and geo-referenced data together with developments in computer software (ARCGIS, CAQDAS) have greatly increased the opportunity to represent and analyze spatial data.

Advances in technology offer researchers opportunities to test new strategies and modalities. This dissertation examined the utility of a wearable device/sensor with website (Fitbit One) and SMS text messaging prompts to increase physical activity (PA) in overweight/obese adults. It also examined participants' level of engagement with intervention components and factors associated with engagement.  Methods: In a 6-week randomized controlled pilot trial, 67 participants were provided a Fitbit One for self-monitoring and half were randomized to receive daily text messaging PA prompts. Primary outcomes were objectively measured steps and minutes of PA by intensity level using Actigraph GT3X+ and Fitbit One. Self-reported baseline and follow-up surveys were analyzed to assess participants' attitudes and level of engagement with intervention components (Fitbit One and text messages), and whether self-efficacy and outcome expectations could predict level of engagement. Secondary data were analyzed from the Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) Study to examine adherence to study protocols and dietary change by baseline depressive symptoms in women who were enrolled in a large dietary trial that focused on behavioral activation components. Results: (1) Daily text messaging prompts were associated with short-term PA increases but only for 1 week, and Fitbit One (without text messages) was associated with an increase in MVPA at week 6. (2) Participants who used the Fitbit mobile app increased their steps at week 6. (3) Baseline depressive symptoms predicted lower adherence to study protocols, but only in control participants, and (among those furthest from recommended targets at baseline) less improvements in change in plasma carotenoid concentrations, fiber, and fat. Conclusions: Participants' level of engagement with the study intervention was associated with health behavior change. Text messages as PA prompts were insufficient to keep participants engaged to maintain PA changes beyond 1 week. Fitbit One, particularly the Fitbit mobile app, which is both accessible and provides instant detailed feedback for self-monitoring, was helpful in increasing PA. Lastly, a dietary intervention with behavioral activation components increased level of engagement in both non-depressed and depressed women who made dietary improvements.

Consumer self-monitoring mobile phone apps have been widely studied and used to promote healthy behavior changes. Data collected through life-logging apps also have the potential to support clinical care. Objective: We sought to develop an in-depth understanding of providers’ facilitators and barriers to successfully integrating life-log data into their practices and creating better experiences. We specifically investigated three research questions: How do providers currently use patient-collected life-log data in clinical practice? What are provider concerns and needs with respect to this data? What are the constraints for providers to integrate this type of data into their workflows? Methods: We interviewed 21 health care providers—physicians, dietitians, a nurse practitioner, and a behavioral psychologist—who work with obese and irritable bowel syndrome patients. We transcribed and analyzed interviews according to thematic analysis and an affinity diagramming process. Results: Providers reported using self-monitoring data to enhance provider-patient communication, develop personalized treatment plans, and to motivate and educate patients, in addition to using them as diagnostic and adherence tools. However, limitations associated with current systems and workflows create barriers to regular and effective review of this data. These barriers include a lack of time to review detailed records, questions about providers' expertise to review it, and skepticism about additional benefits offered by reviewing data. Current self-monitoring tools also often lack flexibility, standardized formats, and mechanisms to share data with providers. Conclusions: Variations in provider needs affect tracking and reviewing needs. Systems to support diagnosis might require better reliability and resolution, while systems to support interaction should support collaborative reflection and communication. Automatic synthesis of data logs could help providers focus on educational goals while communication of contextual information might help providers better understand patient values. We also discuss how current mobile apps and provider systems do, and do not, support these goals, and future design opportunities to realize the potential benefits of using life-logging tools in clinical care.

The Health Promotion Board of Singapore has created a caloric-monitoring mobile health app, the “interactive Diet and Activity Tracker” (iDAT). Objective: The objective was to identify and describe short-term (8-week) trajectories of use of the iDAT app among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a primary care setting in Singapore, and identify patient characteristics associated with each trajectory. Methods: A total of 84 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus from a public primary care clinic in Singapore who had not previously used the iDAT app were enrolled. The app was demonstrated and patients’ weekly use of the app was monitored over 8 weeks. Weekly use was defined as any record in terms of food entry or exercise workout entry in that week. Information on demographics, diet and exercise motivation, diabetes self-efficacy (Diabetes Empowerment Scale-Short Form), and clinical variables (body mass index, blood pressure, and glycosylated hemoglobin/HbA1c) were collected at baseline. iDAT app use trajectories were delineated using latent-class growth modeling (LCGM). Association of patient characteristics with the trajectories was ascertained using logistic regression analysis. Results: Three iDAT app use trajectories were observed: Minimal Users (66 out of 84 patients, 78.6%, with either no iDAT use at all or use only in the first 2 weeks), Intermittent-Waning Users (10 out of 84 patients, 11.9%, with occasional weekly use mainly in the first 4 weeks), and Consistent Users (8 out of 84 patients, 9.5%, with weekly use throughout all or most of the 8 weeks). The adjusted odds ratio of being a Consistent User, relative to a Minimal User, was significantly higher for females (OR 19.55, 95% CI 1.78-215.42) and for those with higher exercise motivation scores at baseline (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.80-13.28). The adjusted odds ratio of being an Intermittent-Waning User relative to a Minimal User was also significantly higher for those with higher exercise motivation scores at baseline (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.00-3.32). Conclusions: This study provides insight into the nature and extent of usage of a caloric-monitoring app among patients with type 2 diabetes and managed in primary care. The application of LCGM provides a useful framework for evaluating future app use in other patient populations.

MVPA and sedentary time were assessed using combined movement and heart rate sensing. Time spent TV viewing, using the internet, playing video games, doing homework and reading for pleasure was self-reported. Data on objectively-measured and self-reported outcomes for weekdays was available for 738 (age 14.5y, 55.7% female) and 800 (56.3% female) participants, respectively. Adolescents perceived family functioning and friendship quality (Two subscales: ‘Good friendship qualities’, ‘Friendship difficulties’) was assessed by questionnaire. Analyses were conducted using multi-level linear or logistic regression.Results: Adolescents reporting better family functioning accumulated more MVPA on weekdays (beta; 95% confidence interval: 0.57; 0.17,0.98). Higher scores on the good friendship qualities subscale was associated with greater MVPA throughout the week (weekdays: 1.13; 0.62,1.65, weekend: 0.56; 0.09,1.02) and lower sedentary time on weekdays (−10.34; −17.03,-3.66). Boys from better functioning families were less likely to report playing video games at the weekend (OR; 95% confidence interval: 0.73; 0.57,0.93) or reading for pleasure (weekday: 0.73; 0.56,0.96 weekend: 0.75; 0.58,0.96). Boys who attained higher scores on the good friendship qualities scale were less likely to play video games at the weekend (0.61; 0.44,0.86) or report high homework on weekdays (0.54; 0.31,0.94). A higher score for good friendship qualities was associated with lower odds of girls playing video games during the week (0.76; 0.58,1.00) or reading for pleasure at the weekend (0.61; 0.42,0.88). Girls that reported fewer friendship difficulties had lower odds of high TV viewing (0.76; 0.62,0.93) or playing video games (0.71; 0.52,0.97) at the weekend, and lower odds of reading for pleasure (0.63; 0.49,0.81) or reporting high homework on weekdays (0.70; 0.52,0.95).Discussion: Family functioning and friendship quality exhibit a complex pattern of association with physical activity and sedentary behaviour that varies by sex and day of the week. Findings highlight the potential value of targeting interpersonal aspects of the family and friendships as an adjunct to behaviour change interventions.

Here, we introduce a model that takes into account the motive behind the action. A crucial question is why do we trust people more who cooperate without calculating the costs? We propose a game theory model to explain this phenomenon. One player has the option to “look” at the costs of cooperation, and the other player chooses whether to continue the interaction. If it is occasionally very costly for player 1 to cooperate, but defection is harmful for player 2, then cooperation without looking is a subgame perfect equilibrium. This behavior also emerges in population-based processes of learning or evolution. Our theory illuminates a number of key phenomena of human interactions: authentic altruism, why people cooperate intuitively, one-shot cooperation, why friends do not keep track of favors, why we admire principled people, Kant’s second formulation of the Categorical Imperative, taboos, and love.

Consumer goods companies, scientists, and innovators are competing to find ways to leverage this information. Social media information is considered useful for marketers as they can directly track consumer responses to marketing campaigns, product performance, and the changes in consumer sentiment toward a brand. Many companies have also developed consumer engagement programs through social media. However, the utility of social media learning in product development seems indirect, or perhaps illusive. While many marketers are being challenged to demonstrate return on investment and many sensory and product research professionals are navigating different pathways to leverage social media information, this paper presents a fresh way of conducting the query to generate consumer and product relevant information. Coffee freshness was used as the research topic. The research here confirmed the validity of social media output. It also demonstrated the value of multi-language and cross-sectional queries. Lastly, best practices in social media research were discussed and recommendations were made regarding how to effectively include the social media tool in sensory and the product research toolbox. The authors challenge the sensory product research professionals to include social media data in their future consumer research framework. Failure to leverage social media may result in higher expenses in the cost of product development when compared to using only traditional consumer and product research tools. More importantly, researchers may miss insights that are impractical or difficult to obtain from traditional research tools.

This creates a need for developing new systems that enable relatives to keep track of aged family members. To develop new mobile services for elderly healthcare we tried to identify the most wanted features of a mobile user-interface from the perspective of relatives. Feature mapping was based on two online surveys: one administered to the relatives ( N = 32) and nurses ( N = 3) of senior citizens and the other to nursing students ( N = 18). Results of the surveys, confirmed by face-to-face interviews of the relatives ( N = 8), indicated that the most valued features of the mobile user-interface are Accident Reporting (e.g. falling), Alarms (e.g. fire-alarm), Doctor Visits and evaluation of the General Condition of the Senior. The averaged importance ratings of these features were 9.2, 9.0, 8.6 and 8.5, respectively (on a scale from 0 to 10).

(see record 2015-09772-027). Hernádi et al. reports that neurons in the amygdala, a structure nestled deep in the temporal lobe of the brain, signal long-term goal-oriented plans. To understand the neural mechanisms of goal-oriented planning, Hernádi et al. trained monkeys on a simple task. The scientists set a computer screen in front of the monkeys and, on each trial, showed the monkeys two images side by side. As monkeys deliberated and executed their investment plans, Hernádi et al. recorded the electrophysiological signals produced by neurons in the amygdala. Their recordings led to the discovery of two types of neurons, the activity of which correlated with the future investment behavior of the monkeys. At first blush, it may seem that the planning neurons recorded by Hernádi et al. are simply another type of neuron in the brain that tracks value. Hernádi et al.performed a necessary control experiment: they took away the monkey's freedom to choose how long to invest for and instead compelled him to perform a specific investment behavior, a bit like being made to contribute to a mandatory retirement system such as Social Security. In accord with this idea, both categories of planning neurons discovered by Hernádi et al. were located predominantly in those areas of the amygdala that are most strongly connected with the prefrontal cortex, namely the basolateral nuclei of the amygdala.

The Ecological Model of Health Promotion (EMHP) was the guiding framework for the review. Data sources: The following electronic databases were searched: Cochrane library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and CINAHL Plus with Full Text. Search terms included waterpipe and its many variant terms. Study selection: Articles were included if they were published between 1990 and 2014, were in English, were available in full text and included the age group 10–29 years. Data extraction: Articles which analysed determinants of WTS at any of the levels of the EMHP were retained regardless of methodological rigour: 131 articles are included. Articles were coded in a standard template that abstracted methods as well as results. Data synthesis: The review found that methodologies used to assess determinants of WTS among youth were often conventional and lacked rigor: 3/4 of the studies were cross-sectional surveys and most enrolled non-representative samples. Within the framework, the review identified determinants of WTS at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, organisational, community and policy levels. Conclusions: The review suggests potential interventions to control WTS among youth, with emphasis on creative utilisation of social media, and tobacco control policies that include the specificities of WTS. The review further suggests the need for rigorous qualitative work to better contextualise determinants, and prospective observational and experimental studies that track and manipulate them to assess their viability as intervention targets.

Involving teachers in the design of these activities is important because the designs need to be aligned with the requirements of the specific educational settings. Yet analysing the implementation of the activities with students is also critical, not only for assessment purposes but also for enabling the identification of learning design elements that should be revised and improved. This paper studies a case that applies visualizations to support students' self‐assessment and teachers' inquiry of a mobile learning design. The design is a gamified location‐based learning activity composed by geolocated questions and implemented with the “QuesTInSitu: The Game” mobile application. The activity was designed by seven teachers and enacted by 81 secondary education students organized in a total of 23 groups. Log files, gathered from “QuesTInSitu: The Game,” provided the data for the visualizations, which represented relevant aspects of the group activity enactment (both time used to answer questions and to reach the geographical zone of the questions, scores obtained per zone, etc). On the one hand, the visualizations were discussed with the teachers as a learning analytics tool potentially useful to consider when redesigning the activity, if needed. On the other hand, the study shows that the visualizations led students to make a better diagnosis of their own activity performance.

Design: A triangulation protocol was used, incorporating quantitative and qualitative research methods. A 27-question online survey was sent to all first-year undergraduates twice, with a 9-month interval. An online focus group was conducted at the end of the year, analysed by content and thematically. Self-reported weights and heights were validated against objectively measured data. Results: From a total of 3010 first-year students, 1440 (female = 734) responded at baseline mean (s.d.) age 20 (3.6) years, body mass index 22.3 (4.6) kgm −2, 17% smokers and 80% alcohol drinkers. At follow-up, 1275 students reported a mean weight change of 1.8 (s.d. 2.6) kg over the 9-month period. Self-reported data correlated strongly with measured weights ( r = 0.999, P < 0.001) and heights ( r = 0.998, P < 0.001). Predictors of weight gain were baseline weight ( P < 0.001). Dairy products consumption was associated with less weight gain ( P < 0.001). Fruit and vegetable consumption, and time spent on physical activity or sleeping were associated with neither weight gain nor weight loss. Focus group content analysis revealed weight gain as a major concern, reported by half the participants, and increased alcohol consumption was considered the most common lifestyle change behind weight gain. Thematic analysis identified three main themes as barriers to or facilitators of healthy lifestyles and weight; budget, peer influence and time management. Conclusions: Rapid weight gain is of concern to young adults. Students living away from home are at particular risk, owing to specific obesogenic behaviours. Consumption of fruit and vegetables, and physical activity, despite popular beliefs, were not associated with protection against weight gain.

Robinson, Marissa Krimsky, Lynne Lieberman, Phillip Allen, Katherine Vytal and Christian Grillon ( The Lancet Psychiatry, 2014[Sep], Vol 1[4], 294-302). This Article (published Online First on Aug 26, 2014) was funded by the Medical Research Council and should have had a Gold Open Access license (license type CC BY). The funding details and copyright line in the article’s Summary have been updated in the online version and the Article has been made open access as of Feb 25, 2015. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-57574-028). Background: In four previous studies, we have delineated the role of positive circuit coupling between the dorsal medial prefrontal (anterior cingulate) cortex and the amygdala during aversive processing in healthy people under stress. This translational circuit—the aversive amplification circuit—is thought to drive adaptive, harm-avoidant behaviour in threatening environments. We assess the role of this circuit in the pathological manifestation of anxiety disorders. Methods: For this single-site study, 45 unmedicated participants (22 with generalised and/or social anxiety disorder and 23 healthy controls) were recruited via advertisements from the metropolitan area of Washington, DC (USA). People who applied to participate in the study had to pass an initial telephone screen and comprehensive screening by a clinician at the National Institutes of Health (NIH; Bethesda, MD, USA). People with a contraindicated medical disorder, past or current psychiatric disorders other than anxiety disorders, and those using psychoactive medications or illicit drugs were excluded. Eligible individuals could participate as either a healthy control or a patient, depending on diagnosis. They were asked to use a button box to complete a simple emotion identification task (fearful vs happy faces; 44 trials of each) during functional MRI at the NIH. Functional imaging analysis consisted of event-related activation analysis and psychophysiological interaction connectivity analysis of regions coupled with the amygdala during task performance. Findings: A diagnosis-by-valence interaction was recorded in whole-brain amygdala connectivity within the dorsal medial prefrontal (anterior cingulate) cortex clusters identified in our previous study, driven by significantly increased circuit coupling during processing of fearful faces versus happy faces in anxious, but not healthy, participants. Importantly, and in accordance with contemporary theoretical approaches to psychiatry, circuit coupling correlated positively with self-reported anxious symptoms, which provides evidence of a continuous association between the circuit and subjective symptoms. Interpretation: In this study and our previous work, we track the functional role of one neural circuit from its involvement in adaptive threat biases under stress, to its chronic engagement in anxiety disorders in the absence of experimentally induced stress. Thus, we uniquely map a mood and anxiety-related circuit across its adaptive and maladaptive stages. Clinically, this study could provide a step towards a more mechanistic continuum-based approach to anxiety disorder diagnosis and might ultimately lead to more targeted treatments for patients with anxiety disorders.

Web-based psychoeducational programs for bipolar disorders have also been implemented, yet to our knowledge, none of them have integrated both approaches in one single intervention. The aim of this project is to develop and validate a smartphone application to monitor symptoms and signs and empower the self-management of bipolar disorder, offering customized embedded psychoeducation contents, in order to identify early symptoms and prevent relapses and hospitalizations. Methods/design: The project will be carried out in three complementary phases, which will include a feasibility study (first phase), a qualitative study (second phase) and a randomized controlled trial (third phase) comparing the smartphone application (SIMPLe) on top of treatment as usual with treatment as usual alone. During the first phase, feasibility and satisfaction will be assessed with the application usage log data and with an electronic survey. Focus groups will be conducted and technical improvements will be incorporated at the second phase. Finally, at the third phase, survival analysis with multivariate data analysis will be performed and relationships between socio-demographic, clinical variables and assessments scores with relapses in each group will be explored. Discussion: This project could result in a highly available, user-friendly and not costly monitoring and psychoeducational intervention that could improve the outcome of people suffering from bipolar disorders in a practical and secure way.

Methods: Baseline symptoms from 2922 subjects from two datasets (one clinic based, one online) were aggregated. Common neuropsychiatric symptoms identified by patients/carers as targets of treatment using a dementia SymptomGuide™ were selected. The Global Deterioration Scale was used for clinic staging, and an artificial neural network algorithm, for staging online subjects. Symptom clusters were detected using multiple correspondence analysis and connectivity graph analysis based on relative risk (RR). In a connectivity graph, each pair of nodes (representing symptoms) is connected if their co‐occurrence is statistically significant; direction is indicated as positive if RR > 1 and negative otherwise. Results: Neuropsychiatric symptoms were targeted for treatment in 1072 patients (37%). Agitation (37%) and sleep disturbances (28%) were most common symptoms. One cluster (in people with cognitive impairment, no dementia (CIND) or mild dementia) showed significant co‐occurrence of anxiety and restlessness; decreased initiative was chiefly seen in isolation. A second cluster (in moderate/severe dementia) was defined by significant co‐occurrence of delusions and hallucinations with sleep disturbances; in these subjects, decreased initiative was related to aggression. Conclusions: Two analytical methods identified neuropsychiatric symptom clusters targeted to track the disease course. In CIND/mild dementia, a profile of decreased initiative distinct from depression suggests possible executive dysfunction. In moderate/severe dementia, targets more reflected psychotic symptoms. Visual data displays allow the relationships between multiple symptoms to be considered simultaneously, which commonly is how they present in patients.

This paper presents a critical analysis of one digital health device: computer apps used to self-track features of users' sexual and reproductive activities and functions. After a review of the content of such apps available in the Apple App Store and Google play™ store, some of their sociocultural, ethical and political implications are discussed. These include the role played by these apps in participatory surveillance, their configuration of sexuality and reproduction, the valorising of the quantification of the body in the context of neoliberalism and self-responsibility, and issues concerning privacy, data security and the use of the data collected by these apps. It is suggested that such apps represent sexuality and reproduction in certain defined and limited ways that work to perpetuate normative stereotypes and assumptions about women and men as sexual and reproductive subjects. Furthermore there are significant ethical and privacy implications emerging from the use of these apps and the data they produce. The paper ends with suggestions concerning the ‘queering’ of such technologies in response to these issues.

The researchers conducted a randomized controlled trial of AE with low-income women to determine its impact on dietary behavior and food security. Results: In all, 284 women reviewed at least 1 AE lesson and endorsed it. After AE, women (n = 288) increased in use of food resource management skills (eg, using a budget [ P = .008] and planning meals to include all food groups [ P = .002]).

The authors develop a dynamic discrete choice model of information search and choice under bounded rationality, which they calibrate using a combination of eye-tracking and choice data. Their model extends Gabaix et al.'s (2006) directed cognition model by capturing fatigue, proximity effects, and imperfect memory encoding and by estimating individual-level parameters and partworths within a likelihood-based hierarchical Bayesian framework. The authors show that modeling eye movements as the outcome of forward-looking utility maximization improves out-of-sample predictions, enables researchers and practitioners to use shorter questionnaires, and allows better discrimination between attributes.

However, our understanding of learner activities in open courses is limited by researchers' extensive dependence on log file analyses and clickstream data to make inferences about learner behaviors. Further, the field lacks an empirical understanding of how people experience MOOCs and why they engage in particular activities in the ways that they do. In this paper, we report three findings derived by interviewing 13 individuals about their experiences in MOOCs. We report on learner interactions in social networks outside of MOOC platforms, notetaking, and the contexts that surround content consumption. The examination and analysis of these practices contribute to a greater understanding of the MOOC phenomenon and to the limitations of clickstream‐based research methods. Based on these findings, we conclude by making pragmatic suggestions for pedagogical and technological refinements to enhance open teaching and learning.

The coherence mainly reflects movement-related proprioceptive afference to the cortex. Here we describe a novel MEG-compatible stimulator to generate computer-controlled passive finger and toe movements that can be used as stimuli in functional brain-imaging experiments. The movements are produced by pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM), elastic actuator that shortens with increasing air pressure. To test the applicability of the stimulator to functional brain-imaging, 4-min trains of passive repetitive 5-mm flexion-extension movements of the right and left index finger and the right hallux were produced at 3 Hz while the subject's brain activity was measured with whole-scalp MEG and finger or toe kinematics with an accelerometer. In all ten subjects studied, statistically significant coherence (up to 0.78) occurred between the accelerometer and MEG signals at the movement frequency or its first harmonic. Sources of coherent activity were in the contralateral hand or foot SM1 cortices. Movement-evoked fields elicited with intermittent movements of the right index finger (once every 3.2–4.0s; mean ± SD peak response latency 88 ± 25 ms) were co-located with the respective coherent sources. We further moved the right index finger at 3, 6, and 12Hz (movement ranges 5, 3, and 2 mm, respectively), and analyzed the first 1, 2, and 4-min epochs of data. One minute of data was sufficient to locate the left hand area of the SM1 cortex at all movement frequencies. Sound-induced spurious coherence was reliably ruled out in a control experiment. Our novel movement stimulator thus provides a robust and reliable tool to track proprioceptive afference to the cortex and to locate the SM1 cortex.

We interpret this as showing that mental effort, reflected by a dilation of the pupil, is required to guide gaze toward objects that are relevant to current goals, but that may not be very salient. When mental effort is low, reflected by a constriction of the pupil, the eyes tend to be captured by high-salient parts of the image, irrespective of top-down goals. The relationship between pupil size and visual saliency was not driven by luminance or a range of other factors that we considered. Crucially, the relationship was strongest when mental effort was invested exclusively in eye-movement control (i.e., reduced in a dual-task setting), which suggests that it is not due to general effort or arousal. Our finding illustrates that goal-driven control during scene viewing requires mental effort, and that pupil size can be used as an online measure to track the goal-drivenness of behavior.

Methods: The cost of the intervention development was estimated from a societal perspective. Micro costing methods plus vendor contract costs were used to estimate cost. Staff logs were used to track personnel time. Non-personnel costs include all additional resources used to produce the intervention. Results: Development cost of the interactive web based intervention was $.39 million, of which 77% was direct cost. About 98% of the cost was incurred in personnel time cost, contract cost and overhead cost. Conclusions: The new web-based disease prevention medium required substantial investment in health promotion and media specialist time. The development cost was primarily driven by the high level of human capital required. The cost of intervention development is important information for assessing and planning future public and private investments in web-based health promotion interventions.

Aims: We report a proposed diagnostic criteria and the designing of a mobile application (App) to identify smartphone addiction. Method: We used a novel empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to delineate the trend in smartphone use over one month. Results: The daily use count and the trend of this frequency are associated with smartphone addiction. We quantify excessive use by daily use duration and frequency, as well as the relationship between the tolerance symptoms and the trend for the median duration of a use epoch.

Here, we formulate a dynamic computational model that accurately predicted how tie formation, driven by the interaction history, influences decisions to contribute in a public good game. We used modeldriven functional MRI to test the hypothesis that brain regions key to social interactions keep track of dynamics in tie strength. Activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex tracked the individual's public good contributions. Activation in the bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and temporo-parietal junction was modulated parametrically by the dynamically developing social tie—as estimated by our model—supporting a role of these regions in social tie formation. Activity in these two regions further reflected inter-individual differences in tie persistence and sensitivity to behavior of the interaction partner. Functional connectivity between pSTS and mPFC activations indicated that the representation of social ties is integrated in the decision process. These data reveal the brain mechanisms underlying the integration of interaction dynamics into a social tie representation which in turn influenced the individual's prosocial decisions.

Moreover, serious games align with medical students’ preferred learning styles. The Virtual Emergency TeleMedicine (VETM) game is a simulation-based game that was developed in collaboration with the mEducator Best Practice network in response to calls to integrate serious games in medical education and training. The VETM game makes use of data from an electrocardiogram to train practicing doctors, nurses, or medical students for problem-solving in real-life clinical scenarios through a telemedicine system and virtual patients. The study responds to two gaps: the limited number of games in emergency cardiology and the lack of evaluations by professionals. Objective: The objective of this study is a quantitative, professional feedback-informed evaluation of one scenario of VETM, involving cardiovascular complications. The study has the following research question: “What are professionals’ perceptions of the potential of the Virtual Emergency Telemedicine game for training people involved in the assessment and management of emergency cases?” Methods: The evaluation of the VETM game was conducted with 90 professional ambulance crew nursing personnel specializing in the assessment and management of emergency cases. After collaboratively trying out one VETM scenario, participants individually completed an evaluation of the game (36 questions on a 5-point Likert scale) and provided written and verbal comments. The instrument assessed six dimensions of the game: (1) user interface, (2) difficulty level, (3) feedback, (4) educational value, (5) user engagement, and (6) terminology. Data sources of the study were 90 questionnaires, including written comments from 51 participants, 24 interviews with 55 participants, and 379 log files of their interaction with the game. Results: Overall, the results were positive in all dimensions of the game that were assessed as means ranged from 3.2 to 3.99 out of 5, with user engagement receiving the highest score (mean 3.99, SD 0.87). Users’ perceived difficulty level received the lowest score (mean 3.20, SD 0.65), a finding which agrees with the analysis of log files that showed a rather low success rate (20.6%). Even though professionals saw the educational value and usefulness of the tool for pre-hospital emergency training (mean 3.83, SD 1.05), they identified confusing features and provided input for improving them. Conclusions: Overall, the results of the professional feedback-informed evaluation of the game provide a strong indication of its potential as an educational tool for emergency training. Professionals’ input will serve to improve the game. Further research will aim to validate VETM, in a randomized pre-test, post-test control group study to examine possible learning gains in participants’ problem-solving skills in treating a patient’s symptoms in an emergency situation.

Traditionally these methods assume that multiunit spiking activity has already been correctly spike-sorted. As a result, these methods are not appropriate for situations where sorting cannot be performed with high precision, such as real-time decoding for brain-computer interfaces. Because the unsupervised spike-sorting problem remains unsolved, we took an alternative approach that takes advantage of recent insights into clusterless decoding. Here we present a new point process decoding algorithm that does not require multiunit signals to be sorted into individual units. We use the theory of marked point processes to construct a function that characterizes the relationship between a covariate of interest (in this case, the location of a rat on a track) and features of the spike waveforms. In our example, we use tetrode recordings, and the marks represent a four-dimensional vector of the maximum amplitudes of the spike waveform on each of the four electrodes. In general, the marks may represent any features of the spike waveform. We then use Bayes’s rule to estimate spatial location from hippocampal neural activity. We validate our approach with a simulation study and experimental data recorded in the hippocampus of a rat moving through a linear environment. Our decoding algorithm accurately reconstructs the rat’s position from unsorted multiunit spiking activity. We then compare the quality of our decoding algorithm to that of a traditional spike-sorting and decoding algorithm. Our analyses show that the proposed decoding algorithm performs equivalent to or better than algorithms based on sorted single-unit activity. These results provide a path toward accurate real-time decoding of spiking patterns that could be used to carry out content-specific manipulations of population activity in hippocampus or elsewhere in the brain.

Methods and Results: Researchers searched English media reports collected by the GPHIN between 1997 and 2013 for references to synthetic cannabinoids. They screened the resulting reports for relevance and content (i.e., reports of morbidity and arrest), plotted and compared with other available indicators (e.g., US poison control center exposures). The pattern of results from the analysis of GPHIN reports resembled the pattern seen from the other indicators. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that using media and other open‐source information can help monitor the presence, usage, local policy, law enforcement responses, and spread of NPS in a rapid effective way. Further, modifying GPHIN to actively track NPS would be relatively inexpensive to implement and would be highly complementary to current national and international monitoring efforts.

Mobile phones are ubiquitous and have an increasingly large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms. Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone global positioning systems (GPS) and usage sensors, and their use in identifying depressive symptom severity. Methods: A total of 40 adult participants were recruited from the general community to carry a mobile phone with a sensor data acquisition app (Purple Robot) for 2 weeks. Of these participants, 28 had sufficient sensor data received to conduct analysis. At the beginning of the 2-week period, participants completed a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9). Behavioral features were developed and extracted from GPS location and phone usage data. Results: A number of features from GPS data were related to depressive symptom severity, including circadian movement (regularity in 24-hour rhythm;  r = -.63, P = .005), normalized entropy (mobility between favorite locations; r = -.58, P = .012), and location variance (GPS mobility independent of location; r = -.58, P = .012). Phone usage features, usage duration, and usage frequency were also correlated ( r = .54, P = .011, and r = .52, P = .015, respectively). Using the normalized entropy feature and a classifier that distinguished participants with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score ≥ 5) from those without (PHQ-9 score < 5), we achieved an accuracy of 86.5%. Furthermore, a regression model that used the same feature to estimate the participants’ PHQ-9 scores obtained an average error of 23.5%. Conclusions: Features extracted from mobile phone sensor data, including GPS and phone usage, provided behavioral markers that were strongly related to depressive symptom severity. While these findings must be replicated in a larger study among participants with confirmed clinical symptoms, they suggest that phone sensors offer numerous clinical opportunities, including continuous monitoring of at-risk populations with little patient burden and interventions that can provide just-in-time outreach.

Research Approach: Qualitative, descriptive. Setting: Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and Odette Cancer Centre, both in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Participants: 27 men on ADT. Methodologic Approach: Men were recruited from prostate cancer clinics. Nine focus groups were conducted from November 2013 to April 2014 until data saturation was reached. Probe questions assessed perceptions regarding SED and preferences for a mobile SED intervention. Data were transcribed verbatim, and a thematic analysis was conducted. Findings: Twenty-seven men with a mean age of 73.5 years (SD = 8.1 years) volunteered for the study. Most men were aware of the health risks associated with SED, but most discussed SED in terms of increasing physical activity (PA). Many men were interested in a mobile application to reduce SED and expressed that the design should be easy to use, have an alerting function to interrupt sitting, have the ability to track and monitor PA levels, be tailored to the individual, and involve social support. Conclusions: These findings will inform the development and evaluation of a novel SED intervention to improve health outcomes in this population. Interpretation: Oncology nurses may serve as a motivational factor in encouraging men on ADT to reduce SED.

Many existing accounts of deception imply that in order to act dishonestly one has to use cognitive control to overcome a bias toward the truth, which results in more time and effort. A recent hypothesis suggests that lying in order to serve self-interest may be a rapid, even automatic tendency taking less time than refraining from lying. In the current study, we track the action dynamics of potentially dishonest decisions to investigate the underlying cognitive processes. Participants are asked to privately predict the outcome of a virtual coin flip, report their accuracy and receive bonus credit for accurate predictions. The movements of the computer cursor toward the target answer are recorded and used to characterize the dynamics of decisions.

Methods: This study was conducted with 1146 youth aged 12.5 ± 2.5 years in Spain during 2011–2012. Leisure-time sedentary behavior during out-of-school hours was assessed by accelerometry and self-report. Academic performance was assessed through school grades. Results: Objectively measured sedentary leisure-time was not significantly associated with academic performance. Time spent in Internet surfing, listening to music, and sitting without doing anything were negatively associated with all academic performance indicators (β ranging from −0.066 to −0.144; all  p < 0.05). However, time spent in doing homework/study without computer and reading for fun were positively associated (β ranging from 0.058 to 0.154; all p < 0.05). Five major sedentary patterns were identified. The “high social-low TV/video” and the “low studying-high TV/video” patterns were negatively associated with all academic indicators (β ranging from −0.085 to −0.148; all p < 0.05). The “educational” pattern was positively associated with all academic indicators (β ranging from 0.063 to 0.105; all p < 0.05).

Greater overall involvement in gambling appears to be predictive of harms. The purpose of this study was to examine differences between Internet gamblers with a single or multiple online gambling accounts, including their gambling behaviours, factors influencing their online gambling and risk of experiencing gambling problems. Methods: Internet gamblers (3178) responding to an online survey that assessed their gambling behaviour, and use of single or multiple online gambling accounts. Results: Results revealed that multiple account holders were more involved gamblers, gambling on more activities and more frequently, and had higher rates of gambling problems than single account holders. Multiple account holders selected gambling sites based on price, betting options, payout rates and game experience, whereas single account holders prioritized legality and consumer protection features. Conclusion: Results suggest two different types of Internet gamblers: one motivated to move between sites to optimize preferred experiences with a tendency to gamble in a more volatile manner; and a smaller, but more stable group less influenced by promotions and experiences, and seeking a reputable and safe gambling experience. As the majority of Internet gamblers use multiple accounts, more universal responsible gambling strategies are needed to assist gamblers to track and control their expenditure to reduce risks of harm.

Materials and Methods: The National Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Study of 2010 provided data for this study. Active gaming was assessed as the number of days in the 7 days prior to the survey that students in grades 9–12 (14–18 years of age) reported participating in active videogames (e.g., ""Wii™ Fit"" [Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan], ""Dance Dance Revolution"" [Konami, Osaka, Japan]). Students reporting ≥1 days were classified as active gamers. Logistic regression was used to examine the association among active gaming and demographic characteristics, BMI, sedentary behaviors, and physical activity. Results: Among 9125 U.S. high school students in grades 9–12 surveyed, 39.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval = 37.9 percent, 42.0 percent) reported active gaming. Adjusting for covariates, the following characteristics were positively associated ( P < 0.05) with active gaming: being in 9th and 10th grades compared with being in 12th grade; being of black, non-Hispanic race/ethnicity; being overweight or obese; watching DVDs > 0 hours/day; watching TV > 0 hours/day; and meeting guidelines for aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity. Conclusions: Four out of 10 U.S. high school students report participating in active gaming. Active gamers tend to spend more time watching DVDs or TV, meet guidelines for physical activity, and/or be overweight or obese compared with nonactive gamers. These findings may serve to provide a baseline to track active gaming in U.S. youth and inform interventions that target sedentary behaviors and/or physical activity.

These tools were made available to women participating in a randomized trial testing a Web-based intervention to promote appropriate gestational weight gain. We used data from a baseline survey of pregnant women assigned to the intervention group and log data on women’s use of various intervention features ( N = 873). Women who believed that appropriate gestational weight gain would lead to healthy outcomes for their child were more likely to engage in online goal-setting and self-monitoring. Less positive outcome expectancy beliefs about the relationship between their own weight and baby’s health partially explains why some at risk subpopulations (e.g., African-American women) were less likely to utilize online self-regulatory tools. This study specifies key psychosocial and motivational factors that guide the construction and monitoring of goals among pregnant women. These findings offer guidance for the design of interventions to promote self-regulatory techniques by identifying groups for whom those features are most likely to be useful, as well as psychological determinants of their use.

We use data from two large-scale field experiments and two lab experiments to show that, although personalization can substantially enhance banner effectiveness, its impact hinges on its interplay with timing and placement factors. First, personalization increases click-through especially at an early information state of the purchase decision process. Here, banners with a high degree of content personalization (DCP) are most effective when a consumer has just visited the advertiser’s online store, but quickly lose effectiveness as time passes since that last visit. We call this phenomenon overpersonalization. Medium DCP banners, on the other hand, are initially less effective, but more persistent, so that they outperform high DCP banners over time. Second, personalization increases click-through irrespective of whether banners appear on motive congruent or incongruent display websites. In terms of view-through, however, personalization increases ad effectiveness only on motive congruent websites, but decreases it on incongruent websites. We demonstrate in the lab how perceptions of ad informativeness and intrusiveness drive these results depending on consumers’ experiential or goal-directed Web browsing modes.

Methods: Participants were 698 students from seven four-year colleges in Texas. Participants completed two waves of online surveys regarding tobacco use, knowledge, and attitudes, with 14 months between each wave. Results: The most prevalent products used by the entire sample at Wave 1 were cigarettes, followed by hookah, cigars/cigarillos/little cigars, and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). At Wave 2, prevalence of e-cigarette use surpassed use of cigars/cigarillos/little cigars. Snus and chew/snuff/dip were relatively uncommon at both waves. Examination of change in use indicated that e-cigarette use increased across time among both current cigarette smokers and non-cigarette smokers. Prevalence of current e-cigarette use doubled across the 14-month period to 25% among current smokers and tripled to 3% among non-cigarette smokers. Hookah use also increased across time, but only among non-cigarette smokers, whereas it decreased among current cigarette smokers. Use of all other non-cigarette alternatives remained unchanged across time. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the socio-demographic predictors of Wave 2 e-cigarette use, the only product that increased in use among both current cigarette smokers and non-cigarette smokers. Results indicated that Wave 1 current cigarette use and Wave 1 current e-cigarette use, but not gender, age, or race/ethnicity, were significantly associated with Wave 2 e-cigarette use. Conclusions: Findings underscore the need to track changes in the use of non-cigarette alternatives and call for additional research examining the factors contributing to change in use.

Comparing educational leadership students with national norms on moral reasoning","Educational Administration Quarterly","","0013-161X, 0013-161X","10.1177/0013161X14539807","https://search.proquest.com/docview/1724423393?accountid=14026","Purpose: The public expects school leaders to be moral exemplars, yet prior research indicates that teachers and, more recently, school principals may score lower than other career groups on a widely used measure of moral reasoning, the Defining Issues Test. Moreover, little empirical research has been conducted on educators during leadership preparation in graduate school. The purpose of this research was to create a baseline profile for moral reasoning in educational leadership/administration graduate students in one Southern state and to compare their scores with a composite national average for graduate students across disciplines to see if educational interventions are needed. Research Design: In the summer of 2012, the updated Defining Issues Test–2 was offered via e-mail as an online questionnaire to 539 master’s, educational specialist, and doctoral students in the five advanced-track schools in the study state. The questionnaire also gathered data on the students’ demographics and the virtual test-taking environment. Findings: Complete data for 113 respondents (a 21% response rate) show that the educational leadership/administration graduate students prefer a maintaining norms schema when solving moral problems. In fact, participants scored significantly lower ( M = 30) on postconventional (advanced) moral thinking than the national norm for graduate students across disciplines ( M = 41) and a historical average for graduate students ( M = 53) on the Defining Issues Test. Conclusions: Researchers urge evidenced-based educational interventions for this group—specifically, Rest’s four-component model, which addresses all four moral psychological processes: sensitivity, judgment, motivation, and character. They also recommend beginning ethics instruction with professional identity development. Classification: This is an empirical study.

By analysing these data, insight into the effectiveness of online learning material compared with custom‐designed textbooks for self‐controlled distance study can be gained.

However, conventional methods tend to use a two-stage sampling paradigm in which the search space needs to be uniformly explored with an inefficient preliminary sampling phase. In this paper, we propose a novel sampling-based method in the Bayesian filtering framework to address the problem. Within the framework, nearest neighbor field estimation is utilized to compute the importance proposal probabilities, which guide the Markov chain search towards promising regions and thus enhance the sampling efficiency; given the motion priors, a smoothing stochastic sampling Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed to approximate the posterior distribution through a smoothing weight-updating scheme. Moreover, to track the abrupt and the smooth motions simultaneously, we develop an abrupt-motion detection scheme which can discover the presence of abrupt motions during online tracking. Extensive experiments on challenging image sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of our algorithm in handling the abrupt motions.

Given this scenario, the present work analyzed the impact of a collaborative, tag-based content categorization mechanism in user’s perception of knowledge building in a social bookmarking service. To achieve this we performed a statistical analysis based on usage log data recorded from the tagging interactions and a post-usage online survey with 84 responses. Although the user interaction with content (tagging) would suggest higher levels of learning, the results showed that the perception of knowledge building is not affected by user participation behavior, and lurkers and posters could equally benefit from the service.

Research into this problem has identified several areas where students commonly struggle with fractions. While there are many theories of fraction learning, none of the research on these theories employs samples large enough to test theories at scale or nuanced enough to demonstrate how learning unfolds over time during instructional activities based on these theories. The work reported here uses learning analytics methods with fine-grained log data from an online fraction game to unpack how splitting (i.e. partitioning a whole into equal-sized parts) impacts learning. Study 1 demonstrated that playing the game significantly improved students’ fraction understanding. In addition, a cluster analysis suggested that exploring splitting was beneficial. Study 2 replicated the learning results, and a cluster analysis showed that compared to early game play, later game play showed more optimal splitting strategies. In addition, in looking at the types of transitions that were possible between a student’s early cluster categorization and later cluster categorization, we found that some types of transitions were more beneficial for learning than others.

This paper presents the views of research assistants on the use of cell phones and the Internet to track participants in a multisite randomized trial of substance use disorder treatment. Methods: Preinterview questionnaires exploring tracking and other study-related activities were collected from 21 research staff across the 10 participating US sites. Data were then used to construct a semistructured interview guide that, in turn, was used to interview 12 of the same staff members. The questionnaires and interview data were entered in Atlas.ti and analyzed for emergent themes related to the use of technology for participant-tracking purposes. Results: Study staff reported that most participants had cell phones, despite having unstable physical addresses and landlines. The incoming call feature of most cell phones was useful for participants and research staff alike, and texting proved to have additional benefits. However, reliance on participants' cell phones also proved problematic. Even homeless participants were found to have access to the Internet through public libraries and could respond to study staff e-mails. Some study sites opened generic social media accounts, through which study staff sent private messages to participants. However, the institutional review board (IRB) approval process for tracking participants using social media at some sites was prohibitively lengthy. Internet searches through Google, national paid databases, obituaries, and judiciary Web sites were also helpful tools. Conclusions: Research staff perceive that cell phones, Internet searches, and social networking sites were effective tools to achieve high follow-up rates in drug abuse research. Studies should incorporate cell phone, texting, and social network Web site information on locator forms; obtain IRB approval for contacting participants using social networking Web sites; and include Web searches, texting, and the use of social media in staff training as standard operating procedures.

Mono-dialectal Mandarin speakers, bi-dialectal Shanghai–Mandarin speakers and bi-dialectal Cantonese–Mandarin speakers searched for target Mandarin syllable–tone combinations while their eye movements and mouse clicks were recorded. The results showed dialectal differences in online eye fixation patterns but not in offline mouse responses. For all groups, mouse clicks were fastest for infrequent syllables with most probable tones and slowest for infrequent syllables with least probable tones. In online eye movement responses, only mono-dialectal Mandarin speakers showed an interaction between syllable frequency and tonal probability. Mono-dialectal Mandarin speakers’ fixations were fastest for infrequent syllables with probable tones and slowest for infrequent syllables with improbable tones. Mono-dialectal speakers also showed a greater amount of competition from the more probable segmental competitor when hearing improbable tones. Bi-dialectal speakers showed different timing in their integration of tonal probabilities. These findings suggest that highly bilingual speakers track and use Mandarin tonal probabilities, but their sensitivity to L2 tonal information may lag behind monolinguals for online word recognition.

The authors used data from three panel surveys administered to pregnant women enrolled in a web-based intervention to promote healthy pregnancy and postpartum weight, as well as log data on their use of self-regulatory features on the intervention website. Perceived self-efficacy and perceived safety of physical activity in pregnancy enhanced subsequent intentions to be physically active. Repeated goal-setting and monitoring of those goals helped to maintain positive intentions during pregnancy, but only repeated self-monitoring transferred positive intentions into actual behavior. Theoretically, this study offers a better understanding of the roles of self-regulation activities in the processes of goal-striving. The authors also discuss practical implications for encouraging physical activity among pregnant and early postpartum women.

It refers to the phenomenon whereby individuals engage in activity in a way that significantly exacerbates pain, resulting in periods of incapacity. Overactivity, as a construct, has been derived solely from patients' self-reports, raising concerns about the legitimacy of the construct. Self-reported overactivity reflects an individual's “belief,” collected retrospectively, that their earlier activity levels have resulted in increased levels of pain. This may be different to an individual actually engaging in activity in a way that significantly exacerbates pain. In this study, a 5-day observational study design was used to investigate the validity of overactivity as a construct by examining the relationship between a self-report measure of overactivity, patterns of pain, and objectively measured physical activity over time. A sample of 68 adults with chronic pain completed a questionnaire investigating self-reported habitual engagement in overactivity and activity avoidance behaviour, before commencing 5 days of data collection. Over the 5-day period, participants wore an activity monitor and recorded their pain intensity 6 times a day using a handheld computer. Associations were found between (1) high levels of pain and both high overactivity and high avoidance, (2) high levels of overactivity and more variation in pain and objective activity across days, and (3) high levels of overactivity and the reoccurrence of prolonged activity engagement followed by significant pain increases observed in data sets. These results offer some preliminary support for the validity of overactivity as a legitimate construct in chronic pain.

In this paper we explore the accuracy of using self-reported estimates when compared with actual smartphone use. We also include source code to process and visualize these data. We compared 23 participants’ actual smartphone use over a two-week period with self-reported estimates and the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale. Our results indicate that estimated time spent using a smartphone may be an adequate measure of use, unless a greater resolution of data are required. Estimates concerning the number of times an individual used their phone across a typical day did not correlate with actual smartphone use. Neither estimated duration nor number of uses correlated with the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale. We conclude that estimated smartphone use should be interpreted with caution in psychological research.

In particular, investigators have emphasized improving translation from pre-clinical to clinical research. A specific area of focus has been touchscreen technology; this computer-automated behavioral testing method provides an objective assessment of performance that can be used across species. As part of a larger multi-site study with partners from the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), two US sites, AbbVie and Pfizer, conducted a cross-site experiment with a common protocol for the visual discrimination (VD) task using identical testing equipment, stimuli, and rats of the same strains, sex, and age from the same supplier. As most touchscreen-based rodent experiments have used Lister–Hooded rats that are not readily available outside of Europe, a strain comparison with male Long–Evans rats was conducted as part of the study. Rats were trained for asymptotic performance, and test sessions were performed once per week in a full crossover design with cognition-impairing drugs. Drugs tested were phencyclidine and S-ketamine (N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists), d-amphetamine (indirect dopamine agonist), and scopolamine (muscarinic antagonist). Satellite brain and plasma samples were taken to confirm appropriate exposures. Results indicate that both rat strains show similar patterns of impairment, although Lister–Hooded rats were more sensitive than Long–Evans rats to three out of four drugs tested. This suggests that researchers should fully explore dose–response relationships in their strain of choice and use care in the interpretation of reversal of cognitive impairment.
